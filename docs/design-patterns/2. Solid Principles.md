The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles intended to make object-oriented software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable

The SOLID principle helps in reducing tight coupling. Tight coupling means a group of classes are highly dependent on one another which you should avoid in your code.

Opposite of tight coupling is loose coupling and your code is considered as a good code when it has loosely-coupled classes.
Loosely coupled classes minimize changes in your code, helps in making code more reusable, maintainable, flexible and stable.
## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should only have one job or responsibility.
## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of one large interface, multiple smaller and more specific interfaces are preferable.
## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details, and details should depend on abstractions.

__Example__: Suppose a class `BackendDeveloper` directly depends on another class `Database`. This creates tight coupling between the two classes.

__Violation of DIP:__
```java
class Database {
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to database");
    }
}

class BackendDeveloper {
    private Database database;

    public BackendDeveloper(Database database) {
        this.database = database;
    }

    public void develop() {
        database.connect();
        System.out.println("Developing backend...");
    }
}
```
__Applying DIP:__
```java
interface DatabaseConnection {
    void connect();
}

class MySQLConnection implements DatabaseConnection {
    public void connect() {
        System.out.println("Connected to MySQL database");
    }
}

class BackendDeveloper {
    private DatabaseConnection databaseConnection;

    public BackendDeveloper(DatabaseConnection databaseConnection) {
        this.databaseConnection = databaseConnection;
    }

    public void develop() {
        databaseConnection.connect();
        System.out.println("Developing backend...");
    }
}
```
