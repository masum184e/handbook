Anders Hejlsberg design C#, who is the creator of TypeScript

C# is the combination of good things of Java and C++.

## How .NET execute
```
তোমার C# Code
      ↓
   Compiler
      ↓
IL Code (Intermediate Language)
      ↓
.NET Runtime (CLR)
      ↓
   JIT Compiler
      ↓
   Machine Code
      ↓
Computer এ Run
```
CLR
- Execute the code
- Manages the memory(Garbage Collector)

## C# vs Java
In C#, setter, getter method could be written in a single line
```csharp
public string Name { get; set; }
```
Where in java, it should be written seperatly
```java
private String name;
public String getName() { return name; }
public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
```

## Differences between SDK and Runtime
### SDK

An **SDK (Software Development Kit)** is a collection of tools that developers use to **build applications for a specific platform, framework, or service**.

#### An SDK typically includes:

* **Libraries / APIs** – Prewritten code to interact with a platform
* **Development tools** – Compilers, debuggers, build tools
* **Documentation** – Guides and references
* **Testing tools / emulators**
* Sometimes an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

#### Examples:

* **Android SDK** – Used to build Android apps
* **iOS SDK** – Used to build iPhone/iPad apps
* **AWS SDK** – Used to interact with AWS services

Think of an SDK as a **toolbox for developers**.

### Runtime

A **runtime** (or runtime environment) is the environment that **executes your program after it has been built**.

It provides:

* Memory management
* Execution engine
* Core libraries
* Interaction with the operating system

#### Examples:

* **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)** – Runs Java programs
* **Node.js** – Runs JavaScript outside the browser
* **Common Language Runtime** – Executes .NET applications

Think of runtime as the **engine that actually runs your code**.


### Key Differences

| SDK                                  | Runtime                                    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Used to **develop** applications     | Used to **run** applications               |
| Contains tools, compilers, debuggers | Contains execution engine & core libraries |
| Used by developers                   | Used by end users (or production systems)  |
| Needed during development            | Needed during execution                    |

### Simple Analogy

Imagine building a car:

* **SDK** = The factory tools used to build the car
* **Runtime** = The engine that makes the car move

### Quick Summary

* **SDK → Build**
* **Runtime → Execute**

If you'd like, I can also explain how they work together in a real example like Java or Android.

SDK install করলে Runtime ও automatically পাবে।
