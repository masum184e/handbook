## What is npm?

- npm stands for Node Package Manager
- It is installed automatically with Node.js
- Used to:
  - Install libraries
  - Manage dependencies
  - Run scripts

## What is Node REPL?

REPL stands for:

> Read – Evaluate – Print – Loop

It is an interactive JavaScript environment that comes with Node.js.

**What REPL Does**

- Reads your input
- Executes it immediately
- Prints the result
- Waits for the next command

Think of it as a JavaScript playground in the terminal.

## Starting Node REPL

Open terminal and type:

```
node
```

You’ll see:

```
>
```

That `>` means Node REPL is ready.

```
> function greet(user) {
... return "Hello " + user;
... }
> greet("Alice")
```

- Multiline input uses `...`
- Functions work exactly like browser JavaScript

**Using Built-in Modules**

```
> const os = require("os")
> os.platform()
```

Output:

```
'win32'
```

- `require()` loads Node.js built-in modules
- `os.platform()` returns the operating system

## REPL Special Commands

REPL has dot (.) commands:
| Command | Description |
| --------------- | ----------------------- |
| `.help` | Shows all REPL commands |
| `.exit` | Exit REPL |
| `.clear` | Clear context |
| `.save file.js` | Save session to a file |
| `.load file.js` | Load a file into REPL |

Example:

```
> .exit
```

## When Should You Use Node REPL?

Best Use Cases

- Testing JavaScript logic
- Learning Node.js APIs
- Debugging small snippets
- Quick calculations

When NOT to Use

- Building full applications
- Writing long programs

## Difference Between Node REPL and Node File

Running a JS File

- Create a file `app.js`:
- Run it: `node app.js`

**REPL vs File Execution**

| REPL                 | JS File      |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Interactive          | Script-based |
| Temporary            | Permanent    |
| For learning/testing | For apps     |
