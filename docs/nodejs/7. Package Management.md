npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It lets you:

Install third-party libraries (packages)

Manage project dependencies

Share and reuse code

Packages are installed from the npm registry and tracked in a project using `package.json`.

## Install a Development Dependency

Used only during development (testing, linting, build tools): `npm install nodemon --save-dev`

`package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Global Package Installation

Installs tools accessible system-wide: `npm install -g typescript`

Used for CLIs, not project libraries.

## Managing Packages with npm

1. List Installed Packages: `npm list`
   - For top-level only: `npm list --depth=0`
2. Update Packages: `npm update`
   - Updates packages within allowed version ranges.
3. Uninstall a Package: `npm uninstall express`
   - Removes:
     - Package from `node_modules`
     - Entry from `package.json`

## `package.json`

`package.json` is the main configuration file for a Node.js project. It:

- Stores project information
- Lists required dependencies
- Defines scripts to run the project

It acts as a blueprint for the project.

**Explanation of Key Fields**

| Field             | Description                       |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `name`            | Project name                      |
| `version`         | Project version                   |
| `main`            | Entry file                        |
| `scripts`         | Commands run using `npm run`      |
| `dependencies`    | Packages required at runtime      |
| `devDependencies` | Packages used only in development |

## `package-lock.json`

`package-lock.json` is an auto-generated file that records:

- The exact versions of installed packages
- The full dependency tree
- Package source locations and integrity hashes

It ensures consistent installs across machines.

> You should never edit this file manually.

**Why `package-lock.json` is Important**

- Prevents “works on my machine” problems
- Guarantees same dependency versions
- Speeds up installations
- Improves security auditing

## Dependencies

### `dependencies`

`dependencies` are packages required for the application to run in production.
If these packages are missing, the application will not function correctly.

They are installed automatically when the project is deployed.

### `devDependencies`

`devDependencies` are packages only needed during development, not in production.

They help with: Testing, Debugging, Code formatting, Build processes

### Key Differences Between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`

| Feature                 | dependencies      | devDependencies          |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Required in production  | Yes               | No                       |
| Installed in deployment | Yes               | No (with `--production`) |
| Example packages        | express, mongoose | nodemon, jest, eslint    |
| Purpose                 | App functionality | Development support      |

## Semantic Versioning

Semantic Versioning is a versioning system used by npm packages in the format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### Meaning of Each Version Part

| Part      | Description                        | Example  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| **MAJOR** | Breaking changes                   | `5.0.0`  |
| **MINOR** | New features (backward compatible) | `4.19.0` |
| **PATCH** | Bug fixes only                     | `4.18.3` |

### Semantic Versioning Symbols

1. Caret (`^`) – Most Common: `"express" : "^4.18.2"`
   - Allows updates: `4.18.3`, `4.19.0`
   - Does NOT allow: `5.0.0`
   - Explanation
     - Safe updates (no breaking changes)
     - Default behavior for npm installs
2. Tilde (`~`): `"express": "~4.18.2"`
   - Allows updates: `4.18.3`
   - Does NOT allow: `4.19.0`
   - Explanation
     - Only patch updates
     - More conservative
3. Exact Version: `"express": "4.18.2"`
   - Allows updates: None (locked)
4. Greater Than / Less Than: `"express": ">=4.18.2 <5.0.0"`
   - Used for precise control.
### Check for Outdated Packages
```
npm outdated
```
Output Example
```
Package   Current  Wanted  Latest
express   4.18.2   4.19.0  5.0.0
```
- Current → Installed version
- Wanted → Latest allowed by `package.json`
- Latest → Most recent version

## Publish Custom Package
1. Initialize `npm`
2. Create `index.js` and write the package code
3. Link the package with `npm link`, use it in another project with `npm link my-math-utils`
4. Create an `npm` account with `npm adduser` and login with `npm login`
5. publish it with `npm publish`
