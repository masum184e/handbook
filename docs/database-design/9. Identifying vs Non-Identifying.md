In an ER Diagram, a relationship between entities can either be:

1. Identifying Relationship → when the child entity’s existence and primary key depend on the parent entity.
2. Non-Identifying Relationship → when the child entity exists independently and just refers to the parent entity via a foreign key.

## Identifying Relationship

- Occurs when a weak entity depends on a strong entity.
- The child entity does not have a primary key of its own.
- The parent entity’s primary key becomes part of the child’s composite primary key.
- In ERD (Chen notation): double diamond.
- In Crow’s Foot ERD: the child’s PK includes the FK (solid line).

**Example: Bank Account & Transaction**

- `Transaction` is a weak entity because it cannot exist without an Account.
- Each transaction is identified by (Account_ID + Transaction_ID).

**ER Representation:**

```scss
[ACCOUNT] ◉──(Identifies)──◉ [TRANSACTION]

ACCOUNT
-------------------
Account_ID (PK)
Account_Type
Balance

TRANSACTION
-------------------
Account_ID (PK, FK)
Transaction_ID (PK)
Amount
Date
```

- `Transaction` is identified only when combined with `Account_ID`.
- This makes the relationship identifying.

## Non-Identifying Relationship

- Occurs when the child entity is a strong entity with its own primary key.
- The parent’s primary key is added as a foreign key only (not part of child’s PK).
- In ERD: single diamond.
- In Crow’s Foot ERD: the child’s PK does not include the FK (dashed line or regular line).

**Example: Teacher & Course**

- A `Course` exists independently of a teacher.
- Each course has its own `course_id` as a primary key.
- But we add `teacher_id` as a foreign key to show who teaches it.

**ER Representation:**

```scss
[TEACHER] ──(Teaches)── [COURSE]

TEACHER
-------------------
teacher_id (PK)
Name
Department

COURSE
-------------------
course_id (PK)
course_name
Credits
teacher_id (FK)
```

- `Course` has its own independent key (`course_id`).
- `teacher_id` is just a foreign key reference.
- This makes the relationship non-identifying.

## Key Differences between Identifying and Non-Identifying Relationships

| Feature                 | Identifying Relationship                         | Non-Identifying Relationship                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Entity Type**         | Connects strong → weak entity                    | Connects strong → strong entity                           |
| **Child’s Primary Key** | Includes parent’s PK                             | Independent of parent’s PK                                |
| **Existence**           | Child cannot exist without parent                | Child can exist without parent                            |
| **ERD Symbol**          | Double diamond (Chen) / solid line (Crow’s Foot) | Single diamond (Chen) / dashed/regular line (Crow’s Foot) |
| **Example**             | Account–Transaction                              | Teacher–Course                                            |

**Real-Life Analogy**

- Identifying → Like a transaction receipt: it only makes sense when tied to a specific account.
- Non-Identifying → Like a course: it exists on its own, but you can assign a teacher to it.
