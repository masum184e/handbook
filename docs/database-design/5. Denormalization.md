- Denormalization is the process of intentionally introducing redundancy into a database by combining tables or adding derived data.
- It’s the opposite of normalization.
- The goal is not to “break the rules” but to improve performance in real-world applications.

In short:

- Normalization = Optimize for consistency & integrity.
- Denormalization = Optimize for query performance (sometimes at the cost of redundancy).

## Why Do We Denormalize?

Fully normalized databases are great for data integrity, but they have some problems in practice:

1. Performance Issues
   - In normalized design, retrieving data often requires many joins.
   - Joins are expensive for large datasets.
2. Reporting and Analytics
   - Applications like dashboards, reports, or data warehouses need fast aggregation, not complex joins.
3. Read-Heavy Workloads
   - If the database is mostly used for reads (not writes), denormalization makes sense.
4. Caching Frequently Used Data
   - Instead of computing results repeatedly (like totals or counts), we may store them directly.

## When to Use Denormalization

You should consider denormalization when:

- You need faster queries (fewer joins).
- You have a read-heavy system (e.g., reporting, dashboards).
- The system can tolerate some redundancy.
- You want to precompute aggregates (e.g., order totals).
- You are designing a data warehouse (star schema, OLAP).

**Avoid denormalization if:**

- Your system is write-heavy (because updates become harder).
- Data consistency is critical and anomalies cannot be tolerated.

## Example of Denormalization

Normalized Design (3NF)

`Customer`
| CustomerID | Name | City |
| ---------- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1 | Alice | Dhaka |
| 2 | Bob | Chittagong |
`Order`
| OrderID | CustomerID | OrderDate |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 101 | 1 | 2023-01-01 |
| 102 | 2 | 2023-01-05 |

To get Order with Customer Name & City, we must join:

```sql
SELECT o.OrderID, o.OrderDate, c.Name, c.City
FROM Order o
JOIN Customer c ON o.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;
```

### Denormalized Design

We combine Order and Customer into one table:

| OrderID | CustomerID | Name  | City       | OrderDate  |
| ------- | ---------- | ----- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 101     | 1          | Alice | Dhaka      | 2023-01-01 |
| 102     | 2          | Bob   | Chittagong | 2023-01-05 |

## Types of Denormalization

1. Combining Tables
   - Merging related tables into one (as in Customer + Order).
2. Adding Redundant Columns
   - E.g., Store `CustomerName` directly in Order table.
3. Precomputing Derived Data
   - E.g., Store `OrderTotal` in the `Order` table instead of calculating it from `OrderDetails` every time.
4. Duplicating Tables
   Create summary tables for reporting (like monthly sales).
5. Star Schema / Snowflake Schema (in Data Warehouses)
   - Fact table (sales) + dimension tables (customer, product, time).

## Normalization vs Denormalization

| Aspect   | Normalization                                      | Denormalization                         |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Goal     | Reduce redundancy, improve integrity               | Improve performance, reduce joins       |
| Pros     | Consistent data, avoids anomalies                  | Faster queries, better for reporting    |
| Cons     | Slow queries (many joins), not optimized for reads | Redundancy, anomalies possible          |
| Best Use | OLTP (transactional systems)                       | OLAP (reporting, analytics, warehouses) |
