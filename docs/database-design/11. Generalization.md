Generalization is the opposite of specialization. It is the process of combining two or more lower-level entities into a higher-level entity (superclass) based on their common attributes.

- It answers the question: “What common entity can these subtypes belong to?”
- It is a bottom-up approach.

Key Points:

1. Bottom-up approach (starts with specific entities and abstracts them into a generalized entity).
2. Used when multiple entities share common attributes.
3. Avoids redundancy by placing shared attributes in the generalized superclass.

**Example**

Suppose we have two entities:

- `Car` → attributes: `Car_ID, Model, Color`
- `Bike` → attributes: `Bike_ID, Model, Color`

Both share common attributes: `Model, Color`.
Instead of keeping them separately with redundant attributes, we can create a generalized entity:

- Superclass → Vehicle (Vehicle_ID, Model, Color)
- Subclasses → Car, Bike

**ER Representation (textual):**

```scss
       Car         Bike
   (Car_ID, ...)  (Bike_ID, ...)
        \          /
         \        /
          Vehicle
     (Vehicle_ID, Model, Color)
```

Here, Generalization merges `Car` and `Bike` into a general entity `Vehicle`.

## Difference Between Specialization and Generalization

| Aspect            | Specialization                              | Generalization                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Approach          | **Top-down** (from general to specific)     | **Bottom-up** (from specific to general)        |
| Purpose           | To create subtypes with distinct attributes | To merge common attributes into a single entity |
| Example           | Employee → FullTime, PartTime               | Car + Bike → Vehicle                            |
| Relationship type | “IS-A” (Employee **is a** FullTime)         | “IS-A” (Car **is a** Vehicle)                   |
