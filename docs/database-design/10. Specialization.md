Specialization is the process of dividing a higher-level entity (superclass) into two or more lower-level entities (subclasses) based on some distinguishing characteristic.

- It answers the question: “What specific subtypes exist for this general entity?”
- Subclasses inherit all attributes and relationships of the superclass, but they can also have their own unique attributes.

Key Points:

1. Top-down approach (starts with a general entity and divides it into specific entities).
2. Helps to represent “is-a” relationship (e.g., A Doctor is an Employee).
3. Useful when different subgroups have unique attributes/roles.

**Example**

Consider an entity `Employee` with attributes: `Emp_ID`, `name`, `Salary`.

Now, employees can be of two types:

- `FullTime_Employee` → has an extra attribute `Benefits`.
- `PartTime_Employee` → has an extra attribute `Hourly_Rate`.

So:

- Superclass → Employee
- Subclasses → FullTime_Employee, PartTime_Employee

Here, Specialization divides a broad entity (`Employee`) into specialized subtypes (`FullTime` and `PartTime`).

**ER Representation (textual):**

```scss
          Employee
      (Emp_ID, name, Salary)
          /         \
 FullTime_Employee   PartTime_Employee
      (Benefits)         (Hourly_Rate)
```
