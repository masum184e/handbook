In an ER model, sometimes the relationship itself (not just the entities) needs to store additional information.

- These extra pieces of information are called relationship attributes.
- They describe properties of the association between entities.
- Represented as ovals attached to the relationship diamond (in Chen notation).

## Why Do We Need Relationship Attributes?

Normally, attributes belong to entities. But in some cases:

- An attribute cannot be assigned to just one entity.
- Instead, it belongs to the relationship itself.

**Example:**

In a Student–Course enrollment system:

- Entities: `student`, `course`.
- Relationship: `enrolls`.
- Attribute: `grade`.

The `grade` cannot belong only to `student` (different grades in different courses), nor only to `course` (different grades for different students).

It makes sense only as part of the enrollment relationship.

## Example of Relationships

**Entities & Attributes**

- `Student` (`student_id`, `Name`)
- `Course` (`course_id`, `Title`)

**Relationship:**

- Enrolls (between Student and Course)
- Relationship Attribute: Grade

**ER Representation (text-based):**

```scss
[STUDENT] ──(Enrolls)── [COURSE]
                  |
                (Grade)
```

`Grade` is stored as part of the relationship, because it belongs to the association of a student with a course.

## Important Notes about Relationship Attributes

1. They are used only when the attribute cannot be assigned to one entity alone.

2. In relational databases, relationship attributes are usually stored in a separate table (junction/associative entity).
   - Example: `Enrollment(student_id, course_id, Grade)`

## When to Use Relationship Attributes

- Many-to-Many relationships (M:N) often require relationship attributes.
- Sometimes in 1:N relationships, if extra information about the relationship needs to be stored.
