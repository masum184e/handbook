A recursive relationship (also called self-referencing relationship) occurs when an entity is related to itself.

- In other words, an entity has a relationship with another instance of the same entity type.
- Useful when modeling hierarchies or networks within the same entity set.

## Key Points of Recursive Relationships

- Entity participates more than once in the relationship.
- Each participation plays a different role in the relationship.
- Requires the use of role names to distinguish how the same entity is involved.

## Types of Recursive Relationships

1. **One-to-One (1:1)** → One instance relates to only one other instance of the same entity.
   - Example: In a company, each employee has one mentor (and that mentor is also an employee).
2. **One-to-Many (1:N)** → One instance relates to many others of the same entity.
   - Example: A manager manages many employees, but each employee has only one manager.
3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)** → Many instances relate to many others of the same entity.
   - Example: In a social media app, a user can follow many users, and can also be followed by many users.

## Example of Recursive Relationships

- Entity: `Employee`
- Attributes: `Emp_ID`, `Name`, `Position`
- Relationship: `Manages`

1. One employee can manage many employees.
2. Each employee is managed by exactly one manager.

**Textual ER Representation:**

```scss
[EMPLOYEE] ──(Manages)── [EMPLOYEE]

Attributes:
Emp_ID (PK)
Name
Position
```

- The same entity (`Employee`) appears twice in the relationship.
- We use roles → “Manager” and “Subordinate”.

## How Recursive Relationships are Implemented in Databases

Recursive relationships are usually implemented by:

1. Foreign Key referencing the same table.

   - Example: In `Employee`, a column `Manager_ID` references `Employee(Emp_ID)`.

   ```scss
   EMPLOYEE
   -------------------
   Emp_ID (PK)
   Name
   Position
   Manager_ID (FK → Emp_ID)
   ```

   This way, each employee record points to their manager within the same table.

2. Junction Table (for M:N recursive relationships).

   - Example: For `User` follows `User`, create a `Follows` table:

   ```scss
   FOLLOWS
   -------------------
   Follower_ID (FK → User_ID)
   Followed_ID (FK → User_ID)
   ```

   This allows many-to-many self-referencing
