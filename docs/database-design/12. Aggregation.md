Aggregation is an abstract relationship used when we need to represent a relationship between a relationship and an entity.

- In simple words: when a relationship itself needs to participate in another relationship, we use aggregation.
- It is sometimes called a “has-a” or “part-of” relationship.
- Graphically, in ER diagrams, an aggregation is represented by a rectangle (entity) connected to a diamond (relationship) enclosed in another rectangle.

## Why Aggregation is Needed?

Normally, ER diagrams allow:

- Entity ↔ Entity relationships.

But what if we need:

- Entity ↔ Relationship relationships?

For example, a relationship (say “Works_On”) itself needs to connect with another entity (say Project_Manager). In such cases, normal ER model is insufficient, so aggregation comes into play.

## Example of Aggregation

- Entities:
  - Employee (`Emp_ID, name`)
  - Project (`Proj_ID, Title`)
  - Department (`Dept_ID, Dept_Name`)
- Relationship:
  - Works_On (Employee ↔ Project)

Now, suppose we want to represent: _A department controls the “Works_On” relationship between employee and project._

This means:

- A department doesn’t directly control a project or an employee individually.
- Instead, it controls the association of an employee working on a project.

Here’s where aggregation is needed:

- We treat the relationship Works_On as an abstract entity, and then relate it with Department using another relationship (say, Controls).

**ER Representation (textual)**

```scss
 Employee -------- Works_On -------- Project
                        |
                        |
                  [Aggregation]
                        |
                  Controls (by)
                        |
                   Department
```

- Works_On (relationship) is aggregated and treated like an entity.
- Then Controls relates `Department` to this aggregated relationship.

## Key Characteristics of Aggregation

1. Represents higher-level abstraction (relationship of relationship).
2. Avoids redundancy – instead of connecting department separately to employee and project, we connect it to their association.
3. Expresses real-world semantics more naturally.
