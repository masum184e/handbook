A data model is a blueprint for how data will be structured and managed. Database design usually progresses through three levels:

## Conceptual Data Model

- High-level model that represents the overall structure of data in the organization.
- Focuses on business requirements and entities (things we store data about) and their relationships.
- Does not include details like data types, constraints, or implementation.
- Usually represented as an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.

**Example:**

Entities:

- student
- course
- faculty

Relationships:

- student enrolls in course
- faculty teaches course

Conceptual model answers: What data do we need?

## Logical Data Model

- More detailed than conceptual model.
- Converts entities and relationships into tables, columns, and keys.
- Still independent of specific DBMS (not tied to MySQL, Oracle, etc.).
- Includes attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys, but no storage/technical details.

**Example:**

Tables derived from entities:

Student Table:

- student_id (PK)
- name
- dept

Course Table:

- course_id (PK)
- course_name
- credit_hours

Faculty Table:

- faculty_id (PK)
- name

Enrollment Table (relationship between student & course):

- enrollment_id (PK)
- student_id (FK → student)
- course_id (FK → course)
- grade

Logical model answers: How will the data be structured logically?

## Physical Data Model

- The implementation-level model that shows how the database will actually be created in a specific DBMS.
- Includes table structures, data types, indexes, storage details, constraints, performance tuning.
- Depends on the DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.).

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    dept VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE course (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    credit_hours INT
);

CREATE TABLE faculty (
    faculty_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE enrollment (
    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    grade CHAR(2),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES student(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES course(course_id)
);
```

Physical model answers: How will the data be stored in the database system?

## Comparison of Data Model

| Aspect                | Conceptual Model                  | Logical Model                            | Physical Model                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**             | Business entities & relationships | Tables, attributes, primary/foreign keys | Implementation in DBMS                    |
| **Audience**          | Business stakeholders, analysts   | Data architects, designers               | Developers, DBAs                          |
| **DBMS Independent?** | Yes                               | Yes                                      | No (DBMS-specific)                        |
| **Details**           | High-level, abstract              | Structured, with attributes & keys       | Includes data types, indexes, constraints |
| **Example**           | “Student enrolls in Course”       | Tables: Student, Course, Enrollment      | SQL code with table creation              |
