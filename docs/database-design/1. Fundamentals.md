## Database vs DBMS

A database does not provide tools to interact with data efficiently, DBMS does.

| Feature              | Database (DB)                           | DBMS (Database Management System)                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**       | Collection of structured data.          | Software to manage and interact with the database.     |
| **Nature**           | Passive (just stores data).             | Active (manages, controls, secures, and queries data). |
| **Content**          | Only contains raw data.                 | Contains programs, rules, and tools to handle data.    |
| **User Interaction** | Users cannot directly interact easily.  | Provides interface (like SQL) for users/applications.  |
| **Security**         | Not provided by database itself.        | Provides authentication, authorization, backups.       |
| **Example**          | Student Records stored in tables/files. | MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL managing those records.      |

## Types of Databases

### Relational Database (RDB)

- Stores data in tables (rows and columns).
- Relationships between tables are established using keys (Primary Key, Foreign Key).
- Managed by Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQL Server.
- Uses SQL (Structured Query Language) for queries.

**Example:**

`students`
| student_id | name | dept | phone |
| ----------- | ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| S101 | Amina | CSE | 01711111111 |

`courses`
| course_id | course_name | credit |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------ |
| C201 | Database Sys. | 3 |

- Relationship: `students` enroll in `courses` via a join table (Enrollment).

### NoSQL Database

- “Not Only SQL” – used when data is unstructured or semi-structured (JSON, XML, documents, key-value pairs).
- Designed for scalability, flexibility, and big data.
- Types:
  - Document-based (MongoDB, CouchDB)
  - Key-Value Store (Redis, DynamoDB)
  - Column-based (Cassandra, HBase)
  - Graph-based (Neo4j)

**Example:**

A product entry in JSON format:

```json
{
  "product_id": "P101",
  "name": "Laptop",
  "price": 700,
  "reviews": [
    { "user": "Amina", "rating": 5 },
    { "user": "Rahim", "rating": 4 }
  ]
}
```

Flexible for data that changes frequently (reviews, social media posts).

### Distributed Database

- A single logical database that is spread across multiple locations/servers.
- Can be homogeneous (same DBMS everywhere) or heterogeneous (different DBMS).
- Increases availability, performance, and reliability.

**Example: Banking System**

- Customer data stored in Dhaka branch server.
- Transaction data stored in Chittagong branch server.
- A central DBMS coordinates queries across all servers.

Ensures high availability & quick access for global organizations.

### Cloud Database

- Database that runs on a cloud platform (AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure SQL).
- Provides scalability, pay-as-you-go pricing, automatic backup.
- Accessible from anywhere via internet.

**Example: Netflix**

- Stores millions of user profiles, watch history, and recommendations in cloud databases.
- Scaling is automatic when user demand spikes.

Best for web/mobile apps that need global access.

### Object-Oriented Database

- Stores data as objects (similar to object-oriented programming).
- Each object has attributes (data) and methods (functions).
- Example systems: db4o, ObjectDB.

**Example: Multimedia Application**

- A "Video" object contains:
- Attributes: Title, Duration, Size.
- Methods: play(), pause(), stop().

Great for applications needing complex data types like images, audio, video

## Why is Database Design Important?

1. Eliminates Data Redundancy
2. Ensures Data Integrity & Consistency
3. Improves Query Performance
4. Supports Scalability
5. Enhances Security & Access Control
6. Facilitates Maintenance & Updates
7. Enables Better Decision-Making
