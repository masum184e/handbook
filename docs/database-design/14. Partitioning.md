Partitioning = dividing a large table (or index) into smaller, manageable pieces (partitions), while still treating it as one logical table in SQL.

- The database engine automatically decides which partition to read/write based on rules.
- Helps with query performance, parallelism, and maintenance.

## Types of Partitioning

### Horizontal Partitioning (Row-based)

- Rows are divided into subsets based on a condition.
- Each partition contains different rows of the same schema.
- Example: Partitioning `Orders` table by year → `Orders_2023`, `Orders_2024`.

### Vertical Partitioning (Column-based)

- Table is split by columns.
- Frequently used columns stored in one partition, rarely used in another.
- Example: Split Employee into:
  - `EmployeeBasic(EmpID, Name, DeptID)`
  - `EmployeeDetails(EmpID, Address, Photo, ResumeBlob).`

### Range Partitioning

- Rows divided based on ranges of values.
- Example: Partition `Sales` by `SaleDate`:
  - Partition1 → Jan–Mar
  - Partition2 → Apr–Jun, etc.

### List Partitioning

- Rows divided based on discrete values.
- Example: Partition employees by `Region`: Asia, Europe, America.

### Hash Partitioning

- Rows assigned to partitions based on a hash function of a column.
- Example: `MOD(CustomerID, 4)` distributes rows into 4 partitions.

## Example of Partitioning

Table: Transaction(TxnID, AccountNo, TxnDate, Amount)
Partition by year:

- Transactions_2023
- Transactions_2024
- Transactions_2025

**Benefits:**

- Query like `WHERE TxnDate BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-08-27'` only scans relevant partitions.
- Improves performance + allows old partitions to be archived.
