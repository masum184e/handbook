A Digital Certificate is an electronic document that proves the ownership of a public key. It links a public key to the identity of an individual, organization, or device, and is issued by a trusted third party called a Certificate Authority (CA).

Think of it like a digital passport for websites or systems — it validates who owns a public key and whether you can trust them.

## Uses of Digital Certificates

Digital certificates are critical in secure communication, especially over the internet. They are the backbone of:

- HTTPS (SSL/TLS) security
- Authenticating servers and clients
- Preventing man-in-the-middle attacks
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

## Structure of a Digital Certificate

A typical certificate contains:

| Field               | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Subject             | The identity (domain, user, org)                       |
| Public Key          | Public key of the subject                              |
| Issuer              | Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate |
| Validity Period     | Start and end dates                                    |
| Serial Number       | Unique identifier                                      |
| Signature Algorithm | Algorithm used to sign the certificate                 |
| Digital Signature   | CA’s signature on the certificate                      |

## How Digital Certificate Works

1. User visits `https://bank.com`
2. Server sends its digital certificate to the user's browser.
3. Browser checks:
   - Is the certificate issued by a trusted CA?
   - Is the domain name correct?
   - Is the certificate expired or revoked?
4. If valid:
   - Browser extracts the server’s public key from the certificate.
   - Browser uses that key to establish an encrypted connection (via TLS handshake).
5. Communication is now encrypted and authenticated.

## TLS Handshake with Digital Certificate

```
Client (Browser)                           Server (https://bank.com)
      |                                             |
      | --------- Client Hello (TLS request) ------>|
      |<----- Server Hello + Certificate (X.509) ---|
      |                                             |
Validate Certificate:                               |
- Issuer is trusted (e.g., DigiCert)                |
- Not expired                                       |
- Matches domain (bank.com)                        |
      |                                             |
Extract Public Key from Certificate                 |
Encrypt shared secret with server's public key      |
      |                                             |
      |---- Encrypted Key Exchange ---------------->|
      |<------ Server Finished (secured) -----------|
      |------ Client Finished (secured) ------------|
==> Secure HTTPS Communication Starts (TLS session)
```

## Tools used for Digital Certificate

| Tool/Technology         | Use Case                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **OpenSSL**             | Generate certificates, CSR, private keys |
| **Let’s Encrypt**       | Free, automated TLS certificates         |
| **X.509**               | Standard for certificate structure       |
| **TLS/SSL**             | Secure channel using certs               |
| **Browsers (CA store)** | Manage trusted Root CAs                  |

## Trust Hierarchy in Digital Certificates

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

```
              +--------------------------+
              | Root Certificate Authority|
              +--------------------------+
                         |
              +--------------------------+
              | Intermediate CA          |
              +--------------------------+
                         |
              +--------------------------+
              | Server/Device Certificate|
              +--------------------------+
```

- **Root CA:** Highest authority, pre-installed in browsers/OS.
- **Intermediate CA:** Issued by Root CA, used to issue server certs.
- **Server Certificate:** Used by websites, APIs, services.

Your browser trusts the Root CAs and any certs they sign, directly or indirectly.
