## Key Principles of Application Security

| Principle                          | Description                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Threat Modeling**                | Identifying potential threats and attack vectors early in the design phase.           |
| **Least Privilege**                | Give users and systems the minimal level of access needed to perform their functions. |
| **Defense in Depth**               | Layer multiple security measures so if one fails, others still provide protection.    |
| **Secure by Design**               | Ensure that security is a fundamental part of the system architecture.                |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Design secure login and access control mechanisms.                                    |
| **Data Protection**                | Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.                                        |
| **Input Validation**               | Prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.) by validating and sanitizing inputs.       |
| **Auditing and Logging**           | Keep logs of critical actions for monitoring and incident response.                   |

## Security Components in System Design

1. **Frontend (Client-Side) Security**
   - Input sanitization to prevent XSS
   - Secure cookies and HTTP headers
   - Implement CAPTCHA and rate limiting
2. **Backend (Server-Side) Security**
   - API authentication (OAuth, JWT)
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Prevent SQL injections via ORM or prepared statements
3. **Database Security**
   - Encrypt sensitive data
   - Use access control policies
   - Backup and secure data from unauthorized access
4. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS (TLS)
   - Use firewalls and API gateways
   - DDoS protection

## Example of Secure Online Banking System

### Scenario

Design a secure online banking system that allows users to:

- Log in
- View balances
- Transfer funds

### Security in Design

1. **Threat Modeling**
   - Identify threats like: unauthorized access, session hijacking, SQL injection, phishing.
2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for login.
   - Implement OAuth2 + JWT tokens for session management.
   - Use RBAC to control access (e.g., customers vs. admins).
3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt user data and transaction details using AES-256 at rest.
   - Use TLS 1.3 to secure data in transit.
4. **Input Validation**
   - Prevent SQL Injection by using prepared statements in database queries.
   - Sanitize user inputs in the transfer form to avoid XSS attacks.
5. **Session Management**
   - Use HttpOnly and Secure flags on cookies.
   - Regenerate session tokens after login.
6. **Auditing**
   - Log every login attempt, fund transfer, and failed access.
   - Set up alerts for unusual login patterns (e.g., geo-based alerts).

## Consequences of Ignoring Application Security

| Issue               | Consequence                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| No Input Validation | XSS, SQL Injection, Broken Access Control |
| Weak Authentication | Credential theft, unauthorized access     |
| Unencrypted Data    | Data breach, identity theft               |
| No Audit Logs       | No forensic capability after an attack    |
