Public Key Encryption, also called Asymmetric Encryption, is a cryptographic system that uses two different keys:

- A public key (shared openly)
- A private key (kept secret)

Data encrypted with one key can only be decrypted with the other.

This allows for secure data transmission between parties without sharing a secret key in advance, and is essential for:

- Authentication
- Secure communication
- Digital signatures

## Key Concepts of Public Key Encryption

| Concept                | Description                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Key**         | Used to encrypt data; can be shared openly                                 |
| **Private Key**        | Used to decrypt data; must be kept secret                                  |
| **Asymmetric**         | Different keys for encryption and decryption                               |
| **One-way encryption** | You can encrypt with the public key, but only decrypt with the private key |
| **Digital Signature**  | Created by encrypting a hash with the private key to verify authenticity   |

## Common Algorithm of Public Key Encryption

| Algorithm                             | Use                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **RSA** (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)       | Most common, used for encryption and digital signatures       |
| **ECC** (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) | Lighter and faster alternative to RSA, used in modern systems |
| **ElGamal**                           | Less common, but also used in secure messaging                |

## Where Public Key Encryption is used

| Use Case                | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TLS/HTTPS**           | Public/private keys establish secure connections between clients and servers |
| **Authentication**      | Private key signs a token; public key verifies it (e.g., JWT, OAuth)         |
| **Secure Key Exchange** | Used to share symmetric keys securely (e.g., in hybrid encryption)           |
| **Data Protection**     | Encrypt sensitive data for a specific recipient                              |
| **Email Encryption**    | PGP/GPG uses public key crypto to secure messages                            |

## Example of Public Key Encryption

**Scenario:** A client (browser or app) connects to a backend server using HTTPS. We want to ensure:

- The server is authentic (not a fake)
- Data is encrypted during transmission

### TLS Handshake Using Public Key Encryption

1. Server has a public/private key pair
   - Public key is included in its SSL certificate (issued by a Certificate Authority)
2. Client initiates connection
   - Requests server's public key (via the certificate)
3. Client encrypts a random symmetric key with the server’s public key
4. Server decrypts it using its private key
5. Both now use the symmetric key to encrypt the session (fast and secure)

## Security Benefits of Public Key Encryption

| Benefit                       | Explanation                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No shared secret required** | Safer for open networks                                |
| **Identity verification**     | Private key signatures prove authenticity              |
| **Hybrid encryption support** | Works with symmetric encryption for speed and security |
| **Widely trusted**            | Forms the backbone of HTTPS, SSH, and JWTs             |
