SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) plays a crucial role in securing communication between components over a network. Though it's often used interchangeably with TLS (Transport Layer Security) — which is the modern, more secure version — the term SSL is still commonly used to refer to the entire HTTPS security mechanism.

**What is SSL in System Design?**

SSL is a cryptographic protocol that ensures:

- **Confidentiality** – Data is encrypted so that third parties can't read it.
- **Integrity** – Data isn't altered during transmission.
- **Authentication** – The identity of servers (and optionally clients) is verified.

**Where SSL Fits in System Design**

SSL is applied at the transport layer (between the application and network layers). In system design, it's often used in:

- Web applications (HTTPS)
- Microservices (mutual TLS)
- Mobile apps communicating with APIs
- Database access over networks

## SSL Workflow

1. Client connects to server using HTTPS(Initialized request are always HTTPS)
2. SSL/TLS Handshake begins:
   - Server sends its SSL certificate (with public key - server have both public and private key, so its distribute its public to all the client)
   - Client verifies certificate (using Certificate Authority)
   - A shared session/symmetric key is negotiated using public/private key encryption (e.g., Diffie-Hellman)
     - Client generate a symmetric(it's fast) with the public key
     - symmetric key is shared with server and decrypted by servers private key
     - connection established and symmetric key will be used for further uses
3. Encrypted communication starts using the session key
