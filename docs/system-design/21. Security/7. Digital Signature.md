A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that ensures:

- **Authenticity** – verifies the sender’s identity
- **Integrity** – confirms that the message has not been altered
- **Non-repudiation** – the sender cannot deny sending the message

It is the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, but much more secure and verifiable through public-key cryptography.

## How Digital Signatures Work

### Based on Asymmetric (Public Key) Cryptography

Each user has:

- A private key (kept secret)
- A public key (shared with everyone)

### Signing Process

1. Sender creates a message.
2. Computes the hash of the message.
3. Encrypts the hash using their private key → digital signature
4. Sends the message + signature to the receiver.

### Verification Process:

1. Receiver receives the message and digital signature.
2. Computes the hash of the message.
3. Decrypts the signature using sender’s public key.
4. If the two hashes match → message is authentic and unchanged.

## Uses of Digital Signature

| Feature             | Benefit                                  |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Message Integrity   | Detects tampering                        |
| Authentication      | Confirms sender identity                 |
| Non-repudiation     | Prevents sender from denying the message |
| Trust Establishment | Enables secure communication             |

## Workflow of Digital Signature

```
+-----------+             +-------------------+             +-------------+
|   Client  | -- Sign --> |   Send Message    | --> Verify →|   Server    |
+-----------+             +-------------------+             +-------------+
     |                             |                                |
     |-- Private Key --(hash & sign)--->              -- Public Key -->
     |                             |                                |
Message + Signature       →        API Gateway        →     Validated
```
