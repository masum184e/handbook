Independence in system design refers to the ability of system components (modules, services, or subsystems) to function, develop, and scale with minimal or no dependency on others.

## Types of Independence

| Type                         | Description                                                             | Example                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Functional Independence**  | Each module performs a specific task without relying heavily on others. | Logging module, Payment processing            |
| **Deployment Independence**  | Components can be deployed separately.                                  | Microservices                                 |
| **Scaling Independence**     | Only the parts that need more resources are scaled.                     | Independent services for search, analytics    |
| **Failure Independence**     | A crash in one part doesn’t bring down the rest.                        | Docker containers running isolated apps       |
| **Development Independence** | Teams can build and release different modules at different times.       | Frontend and backend teams working separately |
