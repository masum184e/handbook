Decentralization refers to distributing system components (computation, data, decision-making, control) across multiple nodes or locations, rather than relying on a single central authority or server.

Decentralization is often contrasted with:

- **Centralized systems**, where a single node or server manages everything.
- **Distributed systems**, which may still have centralized control but multiple physical machines.

## Core Characteristics of Decentralized Systems

| Feature                        | Description                                                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No single point of failure** | Failure in one node doesn't bring down the whole system.                       |
| **Autonomy of nodes**          | Each node can make decisions independently or semi-independently.              |
| **Peer-to-peer communication** | Nodes talk directly without needing a central server.                          |
| **Scalability**                | System can grow without bottlenecking on a central node.                       |
| **Trustless operation**        | Nodes may not fully trust each other; cryptography or consensus is often used. |

## Components of a Decentralized System

- **Multiple Nodes:** Each running an instance of software or service.
- **Consensus Mechanism:** For agreement among nodes (like in blockchain).
- **Replication / Data Redundancy:** Data is often duplicated across nodes.
- **Failure Handling Logic:** Nodes can detect and recover from failures.
- **Communication Protocol:** Peer-to-peer or gossip protocols.

## Pros & Cons of Decentralization

| Advantages                                  | Disadvantages                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| High availability and fault tolerance       | Complex to design and manage                   |
| Better scalability                          | Data consistency is hard (CAP theorem)         |
| Greater privacy and control for users       | Security issues between untrusted nodes        |
| Resistance to censorship or central control | Slower consensus mechanisms (e.g., blockchain) |
