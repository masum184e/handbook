Disk access latency refers to the time it takes for a system to retrieve or write data to storage, such as a hard drive (HDD) or solid-state drive (SSD). It includes all delays between initiating a read/write request and completing the operation.

Disk latency is orders of magnitude slower than memory or CPU cache access, making it a critical bottleneck in system performance—especially for databases, file systems, or I/O-heavy applications.

## Components of Disk Access Latency

For HDDs (mechanical disks):

1. Seek Time – Time for the read/write head to move to the correct track (avg: ~5–10 ms).
2. Rotational Latency – Time for the disk to rotate to the correct sector (avg: ~2–6 ms).
3. Transfer Time – Time to actually read/write the bits (depends on bandwidth).

For SSDs (flash-based storage):

- No mechanical parts.
- Access latency is much lower (tens to hundreds of microseconds, ~0.05–0.15 ms).
- High throughput via parallel flash channels.

## Disk Latency Comparison Table

| Storage Type | Avg Latency | Notes                               |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CPU Register | \~0.3 ns    | Fastest, on CPU                     |
| L1 Cache     | \~1 ns      | On CPU core                         |
| RAM (DRAM)   | \~100 ns    | Main memory                         |
| SSD (NVMe)   | \~50–150 μs | No mechanical delay, fast           |
| HDD          | \~5–10 ms   | Mechanical delay, slow              |
| Network Disk | 10–100 ms+  | Depends on network and disk backend |

**1 ms = 1,000 μs = 1,000,000 ns**

## Why Disk Latency Matters

1. I/O is often the slowest part of data-intensive systems (e.g., logs, queries, file reads).
2. Blocking disk reads/writes can stall entire threads or services.
3. Can be the primary cause of slow response time or request timeouts in web applications, databases, or APIs.

## Strategies to Minimize Disk Latency

| Technique                            | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use SSDs over HDDs**               | Orders of magnitude faster                                  |
| **Database Indexing**                | Avoid full scans of large disk tables                       |
| **Caching (e.g., Redis)**            | Store frequently accessed data in memory                    |
| **Batching Writes**                  | Group small writes into large blocks                        |
| **Asynchronous I/O**                 | Avoid blocking the main thread                              |
| **Disk Striping (RAID 0)**           | Increase parallel access to disk                            |
| **Log-structured Merge Trees (LSM)** | Write-optimized storage format (used in Cassandra, RocksDB) |
| **Avoid Random Access**              | Favor sequential reads/writes (important for HDDs)          |
