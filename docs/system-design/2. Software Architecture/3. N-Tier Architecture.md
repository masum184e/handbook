N-Tier Architecture (also called Multi-Tier Architecture) is a client-server architecture that separates an application into logical layers (or "tiers"), where each tier is responsible for a specific concern or function. The "N" refers to the number of tiers, typically 3-tier, but it can go up to 4 or more depending on the complexity.

### Characteristics of N-Tier Architecture:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each tier handles a specific responsibility (presentation, logic, data).
- **Scalability:** Individual tiers can be scaled independently.
- **Maintainability:** Easy to update or modify a specific tier without affecting the others.
- **Security:** Layers can be isolated to improve security boundaries.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Tiers can be deployed on separate physical or virtual machines.

### Typical Tiers in N-Tier Architecture

1. Presentation Tier (Client Layer)

   - The user interface layer.
   - Interacts with the user and presents data.
   - Example: HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend or mobile app.

2. Application Tier (Business Logic Layer)

   - Contains the core functionality and business rules.
   - Processes data between the UI and the database.
   - Example: REST API built with Node.js, Django, Spring Boot, etc.

3. Data Tier (Database Layer)
   - Responsible for storing and retrieving data.
   - Contains database management systems.
   - Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

In more complex systems, you may also see:

- Integration Tier (for APIs, services)
- Caching Tier (for performance)
- Security Tier (authentication and authorization)

### Conceptual View of N-Tier Architecture

```

└──────────────────────┘
```

### Benefits of N-Tier Architecture

- Modular development (different teams can work on different tiers).
- Improved fault tolerance (a failure in one layer can be isolated).
- Better reusability and testing.
- Scalability (e.g., scale database separately from frontend).

### Example of N-Tier Architecture

Let’s look at an e-commerce web application built with 3-tier architecture.

1. Presentation Tier

   - Technology: React.js or Angular
   - Function: Allows users to browse products, add to cart, checkout.
   - Example:
     - User accesses https://shop.com
     - UI loads product list and displays them.

2. Application Tier (Backend/API)

   - Technology: Node.js with Express, or Django REST Framework
   - Function: Handles user requests, applies business logic (e.g., check product availability, apply discount, process orders).
   - Example:
     - When user clicks “Buy”, frontend calls an API: `POST /api/order`
     - Backend verifies inventory, updates stock, and processes payment.

3. Data Tier
   - Technology: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
   - Function: Stores product details, user information, order history, etc.
   - Example:
     - The backend runs a query like: `SELECT \* FROM products WHERE category = 'electronics'`
