Software architecture refers to the fundamental structures of a software system and the discipline of creating such structures and systems. It includes:

- Components (modules/services/classes)
- Relationships between components
- Design decisions and trade-offs
- Architectural patterns (like MVC, microservices)
- Technology stack

It is a high-level blueprint that defines the structure, behavior, and interactions of software systems. It focuses on how components are organized and how they communicate, considering both functional and non-functional requirements.

**In system design, architecture helps to:**

- Ensure scalability and performance
- Improve maintainability and extensibility
- Support reusability
- Enhance security and reliability
- Guide team collaboration and reduce technical debt

## Key Elements of Software Architecture

| Element                  | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Components**           | The functional units (e.g., services, controllers, databases)         |
| **Connectors**           | How components interact (e.g., APIs, message queues)                  |
| **Configurations**       | The topology of the system (how components are arranged and interact) |
| **Architectural Styles** | Patterns like monolith, microservices, layered, event-driven, etc.    |
| **Technology Stack**     | Chosen tools/libraries/languages used (e.g., React, Node.js, MongoDB) |
