Monolithic architecture is a traditional software architecture pattern where all components of an application are tightly coupled and run as a single service or executable. It's often used in small to medium-sized applications or in the early stages of development due to its simplicity.

### Structure of a Monolithic Architecture

A monolithic application typically has the following layers:

1. Presentation Layer (UI)
2. Business Logic Layer
3. Data Access Layer
4. Database

All of these layers are part of a single codebase and compiled/deployed together.

### Characteristics of Monolithic Architecture

| Feature                         | Description                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Codebase**             | All functionality is in one project/application.              |
| **Tightly Coupled**             | Components are dependent on each other.                       |
| **Single Deployment**           | Whole application is built and deployed together.             |
| **Shared Memory**               | No network calls between components; function calls are used. |
| **Simple to Develop Initially** | Easy to set up and run during the early phase.                |

### Advantages

- **Simplicity** – Easy to understand, develop, and deploy initially.
- **Performance** – Inter-component calls are in-memory, hence faster.
- **Development Tools** – Mature support in frameworks like Django, Spring Boot, Laravel, etc.
- **Ease of Testing** – Can perform end-to-end testing easily in one place.

### Disadvantages

- **Scalability Limitations** – You can’t scale individual components independently.
- **Tight Coupling** – A change in one part may require redeploying the entire system.
- **Limited Agility** – Difficult for multiple teams to work independently.
- **Deployment Risk** – One bug can crash the whole app.
  Harder Maintenance – As the app grows, complexity becomes hard to manage.

### When to Use Monolithic Architecture

- Small teams or projects with limited scope.
- MVPs (Minimum Viable Products).
- Applications that don't require high scalability or complex integrations.
- Projects where time-to-market is more important than flexibility.

### Transition Path

Many startups begin with a monolithic architecture and later migrate to a microservices or modular architecture as the application scales and requires more flexibility.

### Example of Monolithic Architecture

Let’s consider an e-commerce platform with the following features:

- User Authentication
- Product Catalog
- Shopping Cart
- Order Management
- Payment Processing

```
MonolithicApp/

├── controllers/
│   ├── AuthController.js
│   ├── ProductController.js
│   ├── CartController.js
│   └── OrderController.js
│
├── services/
│   ├── AuthService.js
│   ├── ProductService.js
│   ├── CartService.js
│   └── OrderService.js
│
├── models/
│   ├── User.js
│   ├── Product.js
│   └── Order.js
│
└── app.js
```

All these features are in one project and deployed together.
