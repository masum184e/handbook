Cloud-Native Architecture in system design refers to an approach that leverages the full benefits of cloud computing to build and run scalable, resilient, and manageable applications. It emphasizes microservices, containerization, orchestration, DevOps practices, and automated infrastructure provisioning.

### Key Characteristics of Cloud-Native Architecture

1. Microservices-Based

   - Applications are decomposed into small, loosely coupled services.
   - Each microservice performs a single business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

2. Containerization

   - Each microservice runs in its own container (e.g., Docker).
   - Containers package application code with dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across dev, test, and production.

3. Dynamic Orchestration

   - Tools like Kubernetes manage container lifecycle, scaling, networking, and failover.
   - Services are registered and discovered dynamically.

4. DevOps & CI/CD

   - Agile practices and CI/CD pipelines allow faster development, testing, and deployment.
   - Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, ArgoCD, etc.

5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

   - Infrastructure (networks, VMs, databases) is defined and managed using code.
   - Tools: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Pulumi.

6. Elastic Scalability

   - Cloud-native apps can automatically scale in/out based on load using cloud provider services or Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.

7. Resilience and Fault Tolerance
   - Built-in failover mechanisms.
   - Services handle errors gracefully and recover without manual intervention.

### Benefits of Cloud-Native Architecture

| Benefit                       | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability**               | Services can scale independently.                                               |
| **Resilience**                | Self-healing and fault-tolerant design.                                         |
| **Faster Time to Market**     | Frequent deployments via CI/CD pipelines.                                       |
| **Cloud Agnostic (Optional)** | With Kubernetes and IaC, the architecture can be cloud-agnostic.                |
| **Observability**             | Built-in monitoring, logging, tracing (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, Jaeger). |

### Example of Cloud-Native Architecture

Design a cloud-native e-commerce platform with user login, product catalog, cart, payment, and order management.

| Service             | Responsibility                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **User Service**    | Handles registration, authentication, profile |
| **Product Service** | Manages product listings, categories, search  |
| **Cart Service**    | Manages shopping cart per user                |
| **Order Service**   | Manages orders, order history, status updates |
| **Payment Service** | Integrates with Stripe/PayPal for payments    |

Containerization:
Each service is packaged as a Docker container and deployed via Kubernetes.

**Orchestration:** Kubernetes manages service discovery, scaling, and failover.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales services based on CPU/memory load.

**CI/CD:**

- GitHub Actions triggers builds/tests on push.
- ArgoCD handles continuous delivery into the Kubernetes cluster.

**Infrastructure:**
Defined via Terraform:

- Cloud Load Balancer
- Kubernetes cluster (e.g., EKS/GKE/AKS)
- RDS for SQL
- Redis for caching
- S3 for static file storage (e.g., product images)

**Fault Tolerance:**

- Each service retries on failure.
- Kubernetes auto-restarts failed containers.
- Circuit breakers (via Istio or Resilience4j) prevent cascading failures.
