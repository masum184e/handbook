## What Is Research

Research is a systematic, organized, and scientific process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting information to answer questions, solve problems, or generate new knowledge.

In simple words,
> Research means finding reliable answers using proper methods rather than guesses or opinions.

### Key Characteristics of Research

Research is:

- Systematic – follows planned steps
- Logical – based on reasoning and evidence
- Empirical – based on observation or data
- Objective – minimizes personal bias
- Replicable – can be repeated by others

### Purpose of Research

Research helps to:

- Discover new facts or theories
- Improve existing knowledge
- Solve real-world problems
- Support decision-making
- Advance science, technology, and society

## Types of Research Based on Purpose

Research can be classified in several ways. The most common classifications are based on purpose and approach.

### Basic Research (Pure or Fundamental Research)

Basic research aims to expand knowledge and understanding without focusing on immediate practical application.

**Key Features**

- Theoretical in nature
- Focuses on why and how things happen
- Not aimed at solving immediate problems
- Builds the foundation for applied research

**Example:**

A scientist studies how human memory works in the brain.

**Explanation:**

- The research does not aim to cure a disease immediately.
- It helps understand brain functions, which may later help in medical treatments.
- This is basic research because the goal is knowledge, not direct application.

### Applied Research

Applied research aims to solve specific, practical, real-world problems using existing knowledge.

**Key Features**

- Practical and problem-oriented
- Used in education, health, business, engineering
- Produces immediate or short-term solutions

**Example:**

A researcher develops a mobile app to help diabetic patients manage blood sugar levels.

**Explanation:**

- The research addresses a specific problem (diabetes management).
- The findings are used directly in practice.
- This is applied research because it solves a real-world issue.

### Difference Between Basic and Applied Research
| Basic Research    | Applied Research          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Expands knowledge | Solves practical problems |
| Theoretical       | Practical                 |
| Long-term impact  | Immediate impact          |


## Types of Research Based on Approach
### Qualitative Research
Qualitative research focuses on understanding meanings, experiences, opinions, and behaviors using non-numerical data.

**Key Features**

- Uses words, images, or observations
- Answers “why” and “how” questions
- Small sample size
- In-depth understanding

**Common Methods**

- Interviews
- Focus group discussions
- Observations
- Case studies

**Example:**

A researcher interviews students to understand why they feel anxious during exams.

**Explanation:**

- Data is collected through interviews, not numbers.
- Focus is on feelings and experiences.
- The researcher analyzes themes like fear, pressure, or lack of preparation.
- This is qualitative research.

### Quantitative Research
Quantitative research focuses on measuring variables using numerical data and analyzing them with statistical methods.

**Key Features**

- Uses numbers and measurable data
- Answers “how many,” “how much,” and “how often”
- Large sample size
- Results can be generalized

**Common Methods**

- Surveys with closed-ended questions
- Experiments
- Statistical analysis

**Example:**

A survey measures the percentage of students who pass an exam after attending coaching classes.

**Explanation:**

- Data is collected in numbers (percentages, scores).
- Statistical tools are used to analyze results.
- This is quantitative research.

### Difference Between Qualitative and Quantitative Research
| Qualitative        | Quantitative           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Words and meanings | Numbers and statistics |
| Small samples      | Large samples          |
| Subjective         | Objective              |
| Exploratory        | Confirmatory           |

### Mixed-Methods Research

Mixed-methods research combines qualitative and quantitative approaches in a single study to gain a more complete understanding of a research problem.

**Key Features**

- Uses both numbers and narratives
- Provides deeper and broader insights
- Strengthens research validity

**Example:**

A researcher studies online learning effectiveness by:

- Conducting a survey to measure student performance (quantitative)
- Interviewing students about their learning experiences (qualitative)

**Explanation:**

- Survey results show performance trends.
- Interviews explain why students perform that way.
- Combining both gives a holistic understanding.
- This is mixed-methods research.

| Research Type | Purpose                | Data Type       | Example                        |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Basic         | Expand knowledge       | Theory/data     | Studying brain functions       |
| Applied       | Solve real problems    | Practical data  | Health or technology solutions |
| Qualitative   | Understand meaning     | Words           | Student interviews             |
| Quantitative  | Measure variables      | Numbers         | Surveys, statistics            |
| Mixed-Methods | Complete understanding | Words + numbers | Survey + interviews            |
