## What Is a Research Paper

A research paper is an original scientific document that presents new data, new findings, or new interpretations generated by the author through experiments, surveys, observations, or analysis.

In simple terms,

> A research paper creates new knowledge.

### Key Characteristics of a Research Paper

- Contains original research
- Based on primary data
- Follows a systematic methodology
- Answers a specific research question
- Results are new and unpublished
### Typical Structure of a Research Paper
1. Title
2. Abstract
3. Introduction (problem statement & objectives)
4. Literature Review (brief)
5. Methodology
6. Results
7. Discussion
8. Conclusion
9. References

### Example of a Research Paper

**Example:**

A study measuring the impact of online learning on university students’ academic performance in Bangladesh.

**Explanation:**

- The researcher collects new data through surveys and exam results.
- Statistical analysis is performed.
- The findings are original.
- Since the study generates new evidence, it is a research paper.

## What Is a Review Paper
A review paper is a scholarly article that summarizes, analyzes, and evaluates existing research on a particular topic without producing new experimental data.

In simple terms,
> A review paper organizes and explains existing knowledge.

### Key Characteristics of a Review Paper
- Based on secondary data
- Does not include original experiments
- Synthesizes findings from multiple studies
- Identifies research gaps and trends
- Helps readers understand the current state of research
### Types of Review Papers
- Narrative Review – descriptive summary
- Systematic Review – structured and method-based
- Meta-analysis – statistical analysis of multiple studies
### Typical Structure of a Review Paper
1. Title
2. Abstract
3. Introduction
4. Search Strategy / Methodology
5. Thematic Discussion
6. Comparison of Studies
7. Research Gaps & Future Directions
8. Conclusion
9. References

### Example of a Review Paper
**Example:**

A review of global studies on the effectiveness of online learning in higher education.

**Explanation:**

- The author analyzes 50 previously published research papers.
- No new surveys or experiments are conducted.
- Results from different studies are compared and summarized.
- Since it reviews existing literature, it is a review paper.

## Key Differences Between Research Paper and Review Paper
| Aspect              | Research Paper                 | Review Paper                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Purpose             | Generate new knowledge         | Summarize existing knowledge  |
| Data Type           | Primary data                   | Secondary data                |
| Original Experiment | Yes                            | No                            |
| Methodology         | Experiments, surveys, analysis | Literature search & synthesis |
| Contribution        | New findings                   | Overview & research gaps      |
| Length              | Usually shorter                | Often longer                  |
| Ideal For           | Advancing science              | Understanding a field         |


## When to Use a Research Paper vs. a Review Paper

**Use a Research Paper when:**

- You want to answer a new research question
- You collect original data
- You aim to test a hypothesis

**Use a Review Paper when:**

- You want to understand a topic deeply
- You are starting a thesis or PhD
- You want to identify research gaps

## Importance in Understanding Research Fundamentals
**Why Research Papers Matter**

- Drive scientific innovation
- Provide evidence-based conclusions
- Form the foundation of future studies

**Why Review Papers Matter**

- Save time for researchers
- Provide comprehensive understanding
- Guide future research directions

## Simple Analogy

- Research Paper → Cooking a new dish
- Review Paper → Writing a cookbook review

## Conclusion

In Understanding Research Fundamentals, knowing the difference between research papers and review papers is essential for:

- Academic writing
- Literature review preparation
- Journal selection
- Research planning

Both types are equally important and complementary in the advancement of knowledge.
