A research question is a clear, focused, and specific question that a research paper aims to answer through systematic investigation.

It defines:

- What you want to study
- Why you want to study it
- How the study will be directed

In simple words: A research question tells the reader exactly what problem your research is trying to solve.

## Importance of a Research Question in a Research Paper

The research question is the foundation of the entire paper.

It helps to:

- Guide the research design and methodology
- Decide what data to collect
- Keep the study focused and relevant
- Formulate objectives, hypotheses, and conclusions

Without a clear research question:

- The research becomes unclear
- Results may be irrelevant or unfocused
- The study lacks direction

## Characteristics of a Good Research Question

A strong research question should be:

### 1. Clear and Specific

- Avoid vague or broad terms
- Readers should understand it easily

- ❌ Poor: How does education affect society?
- ✅ Good: How does online education affect academic performance of university students?

### 2. Focused

- Should address one main problem
- Not too many variables at once

### 3. Researchable

- Must be answerable using data, experiments, surveys, or analysis
- Not based on opinions or beliefs
- ❌ Not researchable: Is honesty good for society?
- ✅ Researchable: How does ethical training influence employee honesty in organizations?

### 4. Feasible

- Can be completed within available time, resources, and skills

### 5. Relevant

- Should contribute to existing knowledge
- Should be meaningful in the field of study

## Types of Research Questions

1. Descriptive Research Questions
   - Describe a situation or phenomenon.
   - What are the study habits of high school students?
2. Comparative Research Questions
   - Compare two or more groups.
   - What is the difference in academic performance between online and offline learners?
3. Correlational Research Questions
   - Examine relationships between variables.
   - Is there a relationship between social media use and academic stress among students?
4. Causal (Experimental) Research Questions
   - Identify cause-and-effect relationships.
   - How does sleep deprivation affect cognitive performance in adults?

## How to Formulate a Research Question (Step-by-Step)

1. Choose a Broad Topic
   - Social media and education
2. Do Preliminary Reading
   - Identify gaps
   - Find what previous studies have not answered
3. Narrow the Topic
   - Impact of social media on students’ academic performance
4. Identify Variables
   - Independent variable: Social media use
   - Dependent variable: Academic performance
5. Write the Research Question
   - How does social media usage affect academic performance of university students?

## Research Question vs Research Objectives vs Hypothesis

| Aspect  | Research Question    | Research Objective              | Hypothesis                      |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Form    | Question             | Statement                       | Testable statement              |
| Purpose | What to study        | What to achieve                 | What to test                    |
| Example | How does X affect Y? | To examine the effect of X on Y | X has a significant effect on Y |

## Placement of Research Question in a Research Paper

- The research question is usually found in:
- Introduction section
- After the problem statement
- Before research objectives or hypotheses

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Making the question too broad
- Using yes/no questions
- Including value judgments
- Asking questions without measurable variables

## Conclusion

The research question is the core of a research paper.

A well-formulated research question:

- Gives direction to the study
- Improves clarity and focus
- Ensures meaningful and valid research outcomes
