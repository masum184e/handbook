The Introduction is a crucial part of a research paper because it sets the context, explains the research problem, and justifies why the study is necessary. A strong introduction guides the reader from general background information to the specific objectives of the research.

## Purpose of the Introduction

The introduction aims to:

- Introduce the research topic
- Provide background and context
- Identify the research problem or gap
- Explain the significance of the study
- State the research objectives, questions, or hypotheses
- Briefly outline the structure of the paper (optional)

## Length and Placement

- Usually 10–15% of the total paper length
- Comes after the abstract
- Written in present tense (mostly)

## Key Components of a Research Paper Introduction

A well-structured introduction generally moves from general to specific, often called the funnel approach.

### Background of the Study

Start with broad information related to the topic.

**Example:**
“Online learning has become an integral part of higher education due to advancements in digital technology and increased access to the internet.”

**Purpose:**
Helps readers understand the broader context.

### Review of Existing Knowledge (Brief Literature Context)

Summarize relevant past studies to show what is already known.

**Example:**
“Previous studies suggest that online learning offers flexibility and accessibility; however, findings on its effectiveness in improving academic performance remain mixed.”

**Purpose:**
Demonstrates awareness of existing research.

### Research Gap / Problem Statement

Clearly identify what is missing, unresolved, or problematic in existing studies.

**Example:**
“Despite extensive research, limited empirical evidence exists on how structured online learning affects academic performance in developing countries.”

**Purpose:**
Justifies the need for the current study.

### Research Objectives or Questions

Clearly state what the study aims to achieve.

**Example (Objective):**
“This study aims to examine the impact of online learning on the academic performance of university students.”

**Example (Research Question):**
“How does online learning influence the academic performance of university students?”

### Significance of the Study

Explain why the study is important and who will benefit.

**Example:**
“The findings of this study will assist educators and policymakers in designing effective online learning strategies.”

### Scope and Delimitations (Optional)

Define the boundaries of the research.

**Example:**
“This study focuses on undergraduate students from public universities and does not include postgraduate learners.”

### Structure of the Paper (Optional)

Briefly outline what each section contains.

**Example:**
“The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related literature, Section 3 describes the methodology, and Section 4 presents the results.”

## Sample Introduction

> Online learning has gained significant attention in higher education due to rapid technological advancements and the increasing demand for flexible learning environments. Universities worldwide have adopted online platforms to support teaching and learning processes. While online learning provides opportunities for accessibility and self-paced study, its effectiveness in enhancing academic performance remains a subject of debate.

> Previous research has reported both positive and negative effects of online learning on student outcomes. Some studies highlight improved engagement and performance, whereas others indicate challenges such as reduced interaction and motivation. However, there is limited empirical research examining the impact of structured online learning on academic performance in developing countries.

> Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of online learning on the academic performance of university students. Specifically, it examines the role of interactive tools and instructor feedback in online learning environments. The findings of this research are expected to contribute to the existing literature and provide practical insights for educators and policymakers.

## Writing Style and Language Guidelines

- Use clear and academic language
- Avoid excessive technical details
- Use citations where appropriate
- Do not present results or conclusions
- Maintain logical flow between paragraphs

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Writing an introduction that is too long or too short
- Including detailed results or data
- Failing to clearly state the research problem
- Reviewing too much literature (save it for the literature review section)
