## IEEE-Style Methodology Paragraph Flow

### Paragraph 1 – Overview of the Methodology

Begin with a concise overview of the proposed method. State the overall objective of the methodology and briefly describe the general approach adopted to address the research problem. This paragraph acts as a roadmap for the section.

Purpose:

- Introduce the method at a high level
- Clarify methodological intent

### Paragraph 2 – System Model or Problem Formulation

Define the system model, assumptions, or problem formulation. Introduce inputs, outputs, constraints, and operating conditions. If mathematical notation is required, introduce it carefully and consistently.

Purpose:

- Formalize the problem
- Establish scope and assumptions

### Paragraph 3 – Data Acquisition or Input Collection

Describe how data or inputs are obtained. Include sources, preprocessing steps, sampling strategies, and any normalization or filtering applied. This paragraph should focus on what data is used and why.

Purpose:

- Ensure reproducibility
- Justify data selection

### Paragraph 4 – Core Method or Algorithm

Explain the main methodological steps or algorithmic pipeline. Present the process logically and sequentially, often from input to output. Use equations, flow descriptions, or block-level explanations as appropriate.

Purpose:

- Convey how the method works
- Highlight key operations

### Paragraph 5 – Model Design or System Architecture

Detail the design of the system, model, or framework. Describe components, modules, and their interactions. Avoid implementation-specific details unless necessary for clarity.

Purpose:

- Clarify structure
- Explain design rationale

### Paragraph 6 – Parameter Settings and Configuration

Specify important parameters, hyperparameters, thresholds, or configuration choices. Justify these choices either empirically or based on prior work.

Purpose:

- Support replicability
- Reduce ambiguity

### Paragraph 7 – Implementation Details

Provide practical details such as programming environment, libraries, hardware setup, and execution conditions. Keep this concise and relevant.

Purpose:

- Enable practical reproduction
- Clarify experimental context

### Paragraph 8 – Evaluation Strategy

Describe how the proposed method is evaluated. Introduce performance metrics, validation protocols, baselines, and comparison criteria. Avoid reporting results here.

Purpose:

- Explain how effectiveness is measured
- Prepare for Results section

### Paragraph 9 – Methodological Limitations or Assumptions (Optional)

Acknowledge assumptions or known limitations of the methodology. This demonstrates rigor and transparency.

Purpose:

- Anticipate reviewer concerns
- Improve credibility

### Recommended IEEE Ordering (Concise)

1. Methodology Overview
2. System Model / Problem Formulation
3. Data or Input Collection
4. Core Method or Algorithm
5. System Architecture / Design
6. Parameter Configuration
7. Implementation Details
8. Evaluation Strategy
9. Limitations (Optional)

### IEEE Methodology Writing Guidelines

- Use present tense for your method
- Refer to figures and algorithms explicitly if used
- Avoid results, analysis, or performance claims
- Maintain precise and unambiguous language
