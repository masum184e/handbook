## IEEE-Style Results Paragraph Flow

### Paragraph 1 – Results Section Overview

Begin by briefly stating the purpose of the results section. Identify what aspects of the proposed method are evaluated and reference the evaluation criteria introduced in the Methodology section.

Purpose:

- Orient the reader
- Define evaluation scope

### Paragraph 2 – Experimental Setup Summary

Provide a concise summary of the experimental or evaluation setup. Reference datasets, test conditions, baseline methods, and evaluation protocols, avoiding repetition from the Methodology section.

Purpose:

- Reinforce experimental context
- Enable result interpretation

### Paragraph 3 – Primary Quantitative Results

Present the main quantitative results using tables or figures. Describe what is shown, reference the corresponding figures or tables, and report numerical values without interpretation.

Purpose:

- Deliver core performance outcomes
- Maintain objectivity

### Paragraph 4 – Comparative Results

Report comparative results against baseline or existing methods. Focus on measurable differences across metrics. Ensure comparisons are fair and based on identical conditions.

Purpose:

- Demonstrate relative performance
- Support claims of improvement

### Paragraph 5 – Ablation or Component Analysis (If Applicable)

Present results analyzing the impact of individual components, parameters, or design choices. Reference controlled experiments that isolate specific factors.

Purpose:

- Show methodological robustness
- Justify design decisions

### Paragraph 6 – Statistical or Reliability Analysis (If Applicable)

Report statistical significance tests, confidence intervals, or variability measures where relevant. Avoid interpretation; report outcomes factually.

Purpose:

- Strengthen result credibility
- Demonstrate rigor

### Paragraph 7 – Qualitative or Observational Results (Optional)

Describe qualitative findings such as behavioral trends, system responses, or visual outputs. Reference figures or examples where appropriate.

Purpose:

- Complement quantitative results
- Provide practical insight

### Paragraph 8 – Summary of Key Results

Conclude the section with a concise summary of the main findings. This paragraph should restate what was observed, not why it occurred.

Purpose:

- Reinforce major outcomes
- Prepare transition to Discussion

### IEEE Results Writing Guidelines

- Use past tense when reporting results
- Refer explicitly to figures and tables (e.g., “Table I shows…”)
- Do not explain causes or implications (save for Discussion)
- Avoid restating methodology details
- Present results in logical order aligned with evaluation metrics

### Common IEEE Reviewer Expectations

- Clear correspondence between metrics and results
- Consistent formatting of tables and figures
- Fair and transparent comparisons
- No interpretive language in Results
