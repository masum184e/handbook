`Immediatley Invoked Function Expression` is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.

**Syntax**

```js
(function () {
  // your code here
})();
```

- as it covered with braces, it consider as function expression instead function statement.

Function Expression also works with IIFE

```js
const sum = (function () {
  return 10 + 20;
})();
console.log(sum);
```

`sum` will be `30`, don't need call the function

- it can be used to create private function/variable

```js
(function show(name) {
  var msg = `Hello ${name}`;
  console.log(msg);
})("Masum Billah");
```

- you can't use `show()` neither `msg` outside.
- it's very easy to create private function/variable with ES6s `let` and `const`, just declare it inside `{}`.
