## Features of Arrow Function

### Lexical `this`

- The biggest difference from normal functions is how arrow functions handle `this`.
- In normal functions, `this` depends on how the function is called (dynamic binding).
- In arrow functions, `this` is taken from the surrounding scope (lexical binding).
- Because of this, you cannot change `this` using `call()`, `apply()`, or `bind()` on an arrow function.

### Cannot Be Used as Constructors

Arrow functions cannot be used with `new`.

They don’t have a `prototype` property, so you can’t create objects from them.

```js
const Student = (name) => {
  this.name = name;
};

const s1 = new Student("Masum"); // ❌ TypeError: Student is not a constructor
```

### No `arguments` Object

In normal functions, you can use the special `arguments` object.
In arrow functions, `arguments` is not available (they inherit from parent scope if used).
