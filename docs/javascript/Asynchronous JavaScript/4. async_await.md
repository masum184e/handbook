# async/await

It is a syntax built on top of Promises that allows writting asynchronous code in a manner that looks synchronouse, making it easier to read and write.

- `async` is a function that returns promises.
- `await` - is a keyword which use to pause execution of the function until the promise is resolved or rejected. It can only be used inside `async` function.

```js
const handleOrder = async (orderNumber) => {
  const takedOrder = await takeOrder(orderNumber);
  const proceedOrder = await processOrder(takedOrder);
  const compltedOrder = await completeOrder(proceedOrder);
};
handleOrder(1);
handleOrder(2);
```
