## DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

DRY is a principle that encourages avoiding duplication of code or logic. If something is repeated in multiple places, it should be abstracted into a single place (function, module, class, etc.).

- Reduce redundancy
- Make maintenance easier
- Avoid bugs that happen due to inconsistent updates

```js
// NOT DRY
console.log("Hello, Alice!");
console.log("Hello, Bob!");
console.log("Hello, Charlie!");

// DRY version
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("Alice");
greet("Bob");
greet("Charlie");
```

Now if we want to change the greeting, we only change it in one place.

## WET (Write Everything Twice / We Enjoy Typing)

WET is the opposite of DRY. It’s when code is duplicated instead of abstracted. Sometimes people use WET intentionally for simplicity, or because over-abstraction can make code harder to read.

```js
console.log("Hello, Alice!");
console.log("Hello, Bob!");
console.log("Hello, Charlie!");
```

If we want to change "Hello" to "Hi", we must update every line manually, which is error-prone.

## Comparison of DRY and WET

| Aspect       | DRY                         | WET                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Approach     | Reuse code / abstract logic | Duplicate code                          |
| Maintenance  | Easy, changes in one place  | Hard, multiple changes needed           |
| Risk of Bugs | Low                         | High                                    |
| Example      | Functions, classes, modules | Repeated print statements, copied logic |
