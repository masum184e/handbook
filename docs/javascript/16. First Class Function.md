- Function can be used as value like storing in variable, passing as arguments, returning as value.

## HOF

High Order Function is a function that either:

- takes one or more functions as arguments.
- returns a function as its result.

**Common HOF in Javascript:**

- [map()](#map)
- [filter()](#filter)
- [reduce()](#reduce)
- [forEach()](#forEach)
- [sort()](#sort)

### Custom HOF

**Example:**

```js
const performOperation = (operation) => {
  console.log("Operation Request Accepted");
  return operation;
};
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
const addOperation = performOperation(add);
console.log(addOperation(4, 5));
```

`performOperation` is a HOF
