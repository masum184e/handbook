## Normal `<script>`

```html
<script src="normal.js"></script>
```

The parser pauses:

- Fetches and executes `normal.js`
- Only then continues parsing HTML below

This is why `<script>` tags often go at the end of `<body>` — to avoid blocking HTML parsing.

## `<script defer>`

```html
<script src="defer.js" defer></script>
```

- Parser continues parsing HTML (non-blocking)
- Script is executed after HTML parsing is complete

## `<script async>`

```html
<script src="main.js" async></script>
```

- Script is downloaded in parallel
- Executes as soon as it’s ready
- Might execute before or after parsing finishes

## Multiple Script Handling

When you include multiple scripts using `<script>` tags without `type="module"`,
all of them run in the same global scope (the `window` object in browsers).

```html
<script src="./js/src/declare.js"></script>
<script src="./js/src/index.js"></script>
```

Scripts are executed in the order they appear in the HTML (unless using `async` or `defer`).

Multiple file share data which are in the same global scope, but the run independently.

**When Scripts Do NOT Share Data**

If you use the module system (i.e., `<script type="module">`),
each file runs in its own module scope, not the global scope.

```html
<script type="module" src="./js/src/declare.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="./js/src/index.js"></script>
```

- When we want to use `import`/`export` we have to use `type="module"`
