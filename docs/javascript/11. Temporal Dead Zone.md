Variables declared with `var` are hoisted at the top of their function scope. It means they are initialized with `undefined` even before the code execution reaches the declaration.

However, variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted but they are not initialized. Instead, they are placed in the Temporal Dead Zone from the start ot the block until the declaration is encountered.

TDZ refers to the period during which a variable is in scope but cannot be accessed because it has not been initialized.

`var` variable allocate memory in global `window` object but `let` and `const` memory allocate memory in `script` object which is why it handle differntly and value is not initialized. you can access `var` variable within `window` object(`window.variable_name`) but you can't access `let`, `const` variable except their name.

```js
console.log(x);
console.log(y); // ReferenceError
var x = 5;
let y = 6;
```
