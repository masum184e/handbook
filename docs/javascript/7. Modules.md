Modules are a way to organize and structure code in a more modular and maintainable way. JavaScript modules allow you to split your code into multiple files and then import/export functionality between them.

## ES6 Modules (ESM)

The ES6 module system was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and is used for handling modules in modern JavaScript. It uses `import` and `export` keywords to facilitate the sharing of code between different files.

### Key Features of ES6 Modules (ESM)

- **Static Structure:** The import/export statements are resolved statically, meaning they are evaluated before code execution, which allows for better optimizations (e.g., tree-shaking).
- **Default and Named Exports:** You can have both default and named exports in a module.

## CommonJS Modules (CJS)

CommonJS is the module system used by Node.js before ES6 was introduced. It is based on `require` and `module.exports` for importing and exporting code between different files.

`module.exports` is an object used to export data or functions from a module. Whatever you assign to `module.exports` becomes available when the file is required.

### Key Features of CommonJS

- **Dynamic Structure:** `require()` is executed at runtime, so it supports conditional loading of modules and circular dependencies.
- **Synchronous:** It loads modules synchronously, making it suitable for server-side code but less efficient for the browser.

### How `require()` Actually Works (Behind the Scenes)

When you call: `require("./math");`

1. Resolves the file path
2. Loads the file
3. Wraps it in a function
4. Executes it once
5. Caches the result
6. Returns `module.exports`

That’s why requiring the same module multiple times does NOT re-run it.
