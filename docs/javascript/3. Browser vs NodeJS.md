## JavaScript in the Browser

JavaScript was originally designed to run inside web browsers to make websites interactive.
When you open a webpage, the browser downloads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then runs the JavaScript inside the browser engine (like V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).

### Features in Browser JavaScript

1. DOM Manipulation
   - Can interact with the Document Object Model (DOM), i.e., change HTML elements, styles, attributes.
   - Example: Changing a button’s text or listening for clicks.
2. BOM (Browser Object Model)
   - Access to `window`, `navigator`, `screen`, `location`, etc.
   - Example: Redirecting users to another page with `window.location`.
3. Limited File Access
   - For security, browser JS cannot directly read/write local files (except via `<input type="file">` or APIs like IndexedDB).
4. Networking
   - Can make HTTP requests using fetch or XMLHttpRequest.
   - Example: Fetching API data.
5. Security Sandbox
   - Runs in a restricted environment (sandbox), preventing access to the operating system directly.

## JavaScript in Node.js

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, built on Google’s V8 engine.
It is often used for backend development, file systems, servers, and more.

### Features in Node.js

1. No DOM/BOM
   - Node.js does not have document, window, or alert, because it does not run inside a browser.
2. File System Access
   - Can read, write, and manipulate files with the fs module.
3. Modules (CommonJS/ESM)
   - Code is organized into reusable modules using require() or import.
4. Networking & Servers
   - Can create web servers (using built-in http or frameworks like Express).
5. Access to OS
   - Can use os, path, process modules for system-level operations.
6. Event-driven architecture
   - Uses event loop, async I/O, and callbacks extensively.

## Differences between Browser JS vs Node.js

| Feature         | Browser JS                       | Node.js                           |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Environment** | Runs in browser sandbox          | Runs in server/OS environment     |
| **DOM/BOM**     | Available (`document`, `window`) | Not available                     |
| **File System** | Restricted (no direct access)    | Full access via `fs` module       |
| **Modules**     | ES Modules (`import/export`)     | CommonJS (`require`) + ES Modules |
| **Networking**  | `fetch`, WebSockets              | `http`, `https`, `net`, Express   |
| **Use Case**    | Frontend (UI, user interactions) | Backend (servers, APIs, scripts)  |
| **Security**    | Runs in sandbox                  | Access to OS/system resources     |
