A Light Emitting Diode (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits light when an electric current passes through it. It is a unidirectional component, meaning it allows current to flow in one direction (from the anode to the cathode).

- diod set the path(positive-long to negative-short) of electricity.
- positive portion accept more voltage than negative portion.
- the voltage difference should be 5V.
- It can activate with 50mA but board produce 500mA, that's why **register** must be use with it.

### Controlling

- `digitalWrite()` is used to control the led with digtal output.
- `analogWrite()` is used to control the led with analog output(0-255).
