Infrared (IR) sensors are widely used for object detection, proximity sensing, and remote control systems. They work by emitting infrared light and detecting the reflected signal or decoding signals from IR remotes.

### Types of IR Sensors

- **IR Proximity Sensor**: Used for detecting nearby objects. Emits IR light and detects the reflected light.
- **IR Receiver Module (e.g., TSOP1738)**: Decodes IR signals from a remote control.
- **IR Transmitter and Receiver Pair**: Used in line-following robots or simple communication.

**Passive IR Sensor:**

- Only decode IR signal from objects, can't emit IR signal.

**Active IR Sensor:**

- Transmeter emit IR signal.
- Receiever detect IR signal which build with photo diod/photo transister.
- Transmeter only produce IR signal, but reciever recieves ir, uv, mw signal as well which is filtered at end.

### Applications

#### Object Detection

- Emit IR signal.
- Some signal absorb by the object, some are reflected.
- Reflected signal recieve by reciver and object detected.

#### Black-White

- White color don't absorb any light.
- Black color absorb all light.

### Structure

An IR proximity sensor typically has 3 pins:

- **VCC**: Power supply (3.3V or 5V).
- **GND**: Ground.
- **OUT**: Output pin (digital HIGH/LOW signal).

### Hardware Setup

- Connect VCC to the ESP32's 3.3V (or 5V if supported by the sensor).
- Connect GND to the ESP32's GND.
- Connect the OUT pin to a GPIO pin (e.g., GPIO23).

- accept digital value as HIGH/LOW.
- accept analog value from 0 to 1023, lower value indicate white color, higher one indicate black.

### Controlling

```cpp
#define IR_PIN 23 // GPIO23 connected to the OUT pin of the IR sensor

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);    // Start Serial communication
    pinMode(IR_PIN, INPUT);  // Set IR_PIN as INPUT
}

void loop() {
    int irValue = digitalRead(IR_PIN); // Read the sensor value

    if (irValue == LOW) { // Object detected
        Serial.println("Object Detected!");
    } else {
        Serial.println("No Object");
    }

    delay(100); // Small delay to reduce Serial output clutter
}
```

### Applications

- **Object Detection**: Detect nearby objects using IR proximity sensors like automatic door opening systems.
- **Line-Following Robots**: Use an IR pair to follow a line or detect edges.
- **Remote Control**: Use an IR receiver to decode and respond to remote control signals.
- **Communication**: Simple data transmission using an IR transmitter and receiver.
