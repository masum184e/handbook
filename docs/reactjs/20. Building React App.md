When you develop a React app locally, you usually run `npm start`

This runs a development server that is:

- Slow(er)
- Unoptimized
- Includes debugging tools
- Reloads instantly for developer convenience

A production-ready build is different. It is:

- Optimized for speed
- Smaller in size
- Secure
- Ready to be deployed to servers like Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or traditional hosting

This is done using:

```sh
npm run build
```

## What `npm run build` actuallydoes

React (via tools like Create React App, Vite, or Webpack) performs several critical steps:

### Code Bundling

- Combines all JavaScript files into few optimized bundles
- Reduces the number of HTTP requests

```
src/App.js
src/components/Header.js
src/utils/helpers.js
```

becomes

```
build/static/js/main.8f3a2.js
```

### Minification

Removes: - Whitespace - Comments - Long variable names

Before (development):

```jsx
function calculateTotal(price, tax) {
  return price + tax;
}
```

After (production)

```jsx
function a(b, c) {
  return b + c;
}
```

### Tree Shaking

- Removes unused code
- Only keeps what your app actually uses

```jsx
import { add, subtract, multiply } from "./math";
```

If you only use `add`, the others are removed from the final build.

### Environment Optimization

- `process.env.NODE_ENV` is set to `"production"`
- React disables:
  - Warnings
  - Extra checks
  - DevTools hooks

This improves runtime performance.

### Asset Optimization

- Images are compressed
- CSS is minified
- Fonts are optimized
- Files are renamed with hashes for caching

```
logo.png → logo.4f3d2a.png
```

This allows browsers to cache files aggressively.

### Generates a `build/` folder

After build completes:

```
build/
├── index.html
├── static/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── main.3f4a1.css
│   └── js/
│       └── main.8f3a2.js
```

This folder is what you deploy.

## Serving the producation build locally

You should never deploy without testing the build.

```
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

Runs at: http://localhost:3000

This simulates real production behavior.


## Why production build is faster than development
| Feature          | Development | Production |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Source maps      | Full        | Minimal    |
| Console warnings | Enabled     | Disabled   |
| File size        | Large       | Small      |
| Hot reload       | Yes         | No         |
| Optimization     | No          | Yes        |
