## Controlled Component

A controlled component is a form element whose value is controlled by React state.

> React state is the single source of truth.

## Uncontrolled Component

An uncontrolled component stores its form data in the DOM, not in React state.

> React accesses the value only when needed using a ref.

```jsx
import { useRef } from "react";

function UncontrolledInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef();

  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert(inputRef.current.value);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input type="text" ref={inputRef} />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

1. `useRef()` creates a reference
2. Input value is stored in the DOM
3. React doesn’t track changes
4. Value is accessed via `inputRef.current.value`
5. No re-render on typing

User types → DOM updates → React reads later

## Controlled vs. Uncontrolled

| Feature            | Controlled  | Uncontrolled   |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| Value stored in    | React state | DOM            |
| `value` prop       | Required    | Not used       |
| `onChange`         | Required    | Optional       |
| Validation         | Easy        | Harder         |
| Re-render on input | Yes         | No             |
| Preferred by React | ✅ Yes      | ⚠️ Less common |

## Mixed Approach (Avoid This)

```jsx
<input value={name} ref={inputRef} />
```

Don’t mix controlled and uncontrolled  
React will warn you because this causes unpredictable behavior.
