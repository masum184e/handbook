## Key Characteristics of React

1. **Declarative:** You describe how the UI should look for a given state, and React updates the DOM automatically.
2. **Component-Based:** The UI is broken into small, reusable pieces called components.
3. **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual representation of the DOM to improve performance.
4. **One-Way Data Flow:** Data flows from parent components to child components.

## What is Component-Based Architecture?

In React, the UI is built using components.

A component is:

- A reusable piece of UI
- A JavaScript function or class
- Can accept input (called props)
- Returns JSX (HTML-like syntax)

## JSX in React

React uses JSX, which looks like HTML but is actually JavaScript.

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

Behind the scenes:

```js
React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");
```

## Data Flow in Component-Based Architecture

React follows one-way data flow:

```
Parent Component
      ↓ props
Child Component
```

Example:

```js
<UserInfo name="Alice" age={25} />
```
