JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React. It allows you to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, making UI code easier to read and write.

Although JSX looks like HTML, it is not HTML.
Behind the scenes, JSX is compiled into JavaScript (using `React.createElement()`).

```js
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

This is JSX, not HTML.

Without JSX, React code would be more verbose.

Without JSX

```jsx
const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");
```

With JSX

```jsx
const element = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```



## JSX Is JavaScript Expressions

JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions inside `{}`.

```jsx
const name = "Alex";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
```
- `{name}` is a JavaScript expression
- JSX evaluates it and inserts the value into the UI
- Output: Hello, Alex!
