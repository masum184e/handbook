A Synthetic Event is a wrapper around the browser’s native event.

> React creates a `SyntheticEvent` object to handle events in a consistent, cross-browser way.

Instead of directly using browser events like `MouseEvent` or `KeyboardEvent`, React:

- Listens to events at the top level
- Wraps them in a `SyntheticEvent`
- Passes that object to your event handler

## Why Does React Use Synthetic Events?

Different browsers implement events slightly differently. React solves this by providing:

1. Cross-browser consistency
2. Unified API for all events
3. Better performance (via event delegation)
4. Predictable behavior across platforms

So whether you’re on Chrome, Firefox, or Safari:

```
event.target
event.preventDefault()
event.type
```

all work the same way.

## How Synthetic Events Work Internally (Conceptual)

1. React attaches one event listener to the root of the app
2. When a user action occurs:
   - React captures the native browser event
   - Wraps it in a `SyntheticEvent`
   - Dispatches it to the correct component

This approach is called event delegation.

## Basic Synthetic Event Example

```jsx
function ClickExample() {
  function handleClick(event) {
    console.log(event);
    console.log(event.type); // "click"
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
}
```

- `event` is a SyntheticEvent
- Looks like a normal browser event
- Works the same across browsers

## Event Pooling (Important Interview Topic)

React reuses SyntheticEvent objects to improve performance.

In older React versions, accessing the event asynchronously caused issues.

### Problem Example (Old Behavior)

```jsx
function PoolingExample() {
  function handleClick(event) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(event.type); // null (older React)
    }, 1000);
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;
}
```

### Solution (Old React)

```jsx
event.persist();
```

### Modern React (v17+)

Event pooling was removed  
You can safely use events asynchronously now.

## Synthetic vs Native Events

| Feature               | SyntheticEvent | Native Event |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Browser consistency   | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No        |
| Performance optimized | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No        |
| Same API everywhere   | ✅ Yes         | ❌ Varies    |
| React-managed         | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No        |

## Event Bubbling in Synthetic Events

Synthetic events bubble by default, just like native events.

```jsx
function BubblingExample() {
  return (
    <div onClick={() => console.log("Parent clicked")}>
      <button onClick={() => console.log("Button clicked")}>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Clicking the button logs:

```
Button clicked
Parent clicked
```

Use:

```jsx
event.stopPropagation();
```

to stop bubbling.
