## Actual DOM

DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure created by the browser from HTML.

- Every HTML element becomes a node
- JavaScript can read, modify, add, or delete nodes
- Updating the DOM directly is slow and expensive

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome</p>
  </div>
</body>
```

DOM Tree Representation

```
body
 └── div
      ├── h1
      └── p
```

Problems with the Actual DOM

- DOM manipulation is slow
- Re-rendering affects entire sections
- Performance issues in large applications

```html
<p id="text">Count: 0</p>
<button onclick="update()">Click</button>

<script>
  function update() {
    document.getElementById("text").innerText = "Count: 1";
  }
</script>
```

**What Happens Internally?**

- Browser finds the element
- Updates the DOM node
  - Specific node, not the whole node.
  - It happend for each changes, for virtual dom, for all changes DOM node updates once
- Recalculates layout
- Repaints UI

For many updates, this becomes inefficient.

**Real-Life Analogy**

- Without Virtual DOM: Calling someone every time you think of a change
- With Virtual DOM: Writing all changes on paper, then making one final call

## Virtual DOM

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight JavaScript object that is a copy of the Actual DOM.

- Maintained by React
- Faster to update than Actual DOM
- Changes are first applied to Virtual DOM

React updates the Real DOM only when needed

> React does not update the real DOM directly. It updates the Virtual DOM first, then efficiently updates the Actual DOM.

### How Virtual DOM Works

1. UI is represented as a Virtual DOM
2. State or props change
3. **New** Virtual DOM is created
4. React compares old vs new Virtual DOM (Diffing)
5. React updates only the changed parts in Actual DOM (Reconciliation)

### Virtual DOM vs Actual DOM

| Feature      | Actual DOM     | Virtual DOM        |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Nature       | Browser object | JavaScript object  |
| Update Speed | Slow           | Fast               |
| Re-render    | Entire subtree | Only changed nodes |
| Cost         | Expensive      | Lightweight        |
| Used By      | Browser        | React              |
