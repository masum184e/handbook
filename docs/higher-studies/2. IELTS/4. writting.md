# IELTS Academic Writing Task 1 – Sample Question & Band 9 Answer

### Question
The charts below show the percentage of electricity produced from different energy sources in France in 1990 and 2010.  
**Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.**

---

### Band 9 Model Answer (≈180 words)

The pie charts compare how electricity was generated in France from five different energy sources in 1990 and 2010.

Overall, it is clear that nuclear power became the dominant source of electricity over the 20-year period, while the use of coal and oil declined significantly.

In 1990, coal was the largest contributor to electricity production, accounting for 35%, followed by nuclear power at 25%. Oil and natural gas produced similar proportions of energy (20% and 15% respectively), while renewables made up only 5%.

By 2010, nuclear energy had increased dramatically to 65%, more than doubling its previous share. In contrast, coal and oil dropped to 10% and 5% respectively. Natural gas remained stable at around 15%, whereas renewable sources saw a modest increase to 5%.

In summary, the most notable change over the two decades was the shift towards nuclear energy, which became the main provider of electricity in France, replacing coal as the leading source.

# IELTS Academic Writing Task 2 – Sample Question & Band 9 Answer

### Question
Some people believe that universities should focus on providing graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace.  
Others think that universities should primarily focus on academic knowledge, even if it is not useful for a job.  
**Discuss both views and give your opinion.**

---

### Band 9 Model Essay (≈290 words)

The role of universities has long been debated. While some argue that higher education should mainly equip students with practical skills for employment, others believe that universities should prioritize academic knowledge. In my opinion, both purposes are essential, but practical preparation should be slightly prioritized.

Those who emphasize academic learning claim that universities are centers of intellectual development rather than job training institutes. They argue that studying subjects such as philosophy, history, or pure science cultivates critical thinking and creativity, which can indirectly benefit society. For example, academic research often leads to breakthroughs that have long-term economic and social benefits, even if they are not immediately job-oriented.

However, others argue that with rising tuition fees and a competitive job market, universities should ensure that graduates are employable. Courses that teach practical and technical skills—such as computer programming, business management, or engineering—prepare students to contribute productively to the economy. Graduates who can directly apply their skills at work are more likely to find stable employment and repay their educational investments.

In conclusion, while academic study remains vital for intellectual growth and innovation, universities should focus slightly more on equipping students with skills relevant to modern workplaces. Balancing theory and practice will allow graduates to adapt successfully to the demands of today’s job market.
