# Passage (Short Sample)

*(Adapted from an academic-style text)*


### **Passage:**
The concept of **“green roofs”** – rooftops covered with vegetation – has gained popularity in many cities around the world. Green roofs provide insulation, reduce stormwater runoff, and improve air quality. While installation costs are higher than traditional roofing, long-term benefits include energy savings and increased roof lifespan.

In **Germany**, where green roofs have been encouraged since the 1980s, government subsidies helped them become mainstream. In contrast, adoption in the **United States** has been slower, partly due to higher initial expenses and lack of public awareness.
