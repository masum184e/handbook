## 1. Reading Comprehension (RC)

### Sample Passage (Short)

Although the printing press is often credited with the birth of modern communication, it was the telegraph that truly marked the beginning of instantaneous information exchange. For the first time, messages could be sent over great distances in real time, transforming commerce, journalism, and diplomacy.


### Question 1

According to the passage, the telegraph was significant because it —  
A. made printed materials more widely available  
B. improved the accuracy of news reporting  
C. allowed immediate long-distance communication  
D. replaced written communication entirely  

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Explanation:**  
The passage says, “For the first time, messages could be sent over great distances in real time.”  
That directly supports **C** — the telegraph allowed instant long-distance communication.


### Question 2

The author’s attitude toward the telegraph can best be described as —  
A. indifferent  
B. critical  
C. appreciative  
D. skeptical  

**Correct Answer:** C  

**Explanation:**  
The author highlights the telegraph’s positive impact (“transforming commerce, journalism, and diplomacy”), showing appreciation for its role.


## 2. Text Completion (TC)

### Sample Question 1 (One Blank)

Although she was widely regarded as a ___ scholar, her research was often disorganized and poorly presented.  
A. careless  
B. meticulous  
C. pretentious  
D. brilliant  
E. controversial  

**Correct Answer:** D  

**Explanation:**  
The contrast word **“although”** signals opposite ideas:  

> “Widely regarded as a ___ scholar” (positive)  
> “Disorganized and poorly presented” (negative)  

So she was considered **brilliant** but her work didn’t reflect that.


### Sample Question 2 (Two Blanks)

The artist’s early work was admired for its bold colors, but her later paintings were criticized for their ___ and ___ tones.  
A. vibrant … daring  
B. muted … lifeless  
C. innovative … experimental  
D. subtle … complex  
E. rich … dynamic  

**Correct Answer:** B  

**Explanation:**  
Contrast is shown by **“but.”**  
Early = bold colors → Later = opposite (not bold) → **muted and lifeless** fits perfectly.


## 3. Sentence Equivalence (SE)

### Sample Question

Because the scientist’s theory was so (____), even experts had difficulty understanding it.  
A. lucid  
B. complex  
C. transparent  
D. convoluted  
E. obscure  
F. clear  

**Correct Answers:** D and E  

**Explanation:**  
The sentence means the theory was **hard to understand.**  
Synonyms for “hard to understand” are **convoluted** and **obscure.**  
Both choices create similar meaning, so they form a correct pair.
