The GRE Analytical Writing section measures your ability to:

- Analyze complex ideas
- Evaluate arguments logically
- Articulate reasoning clearly and coherently
- Support claims with relevant examples
- Write controlled, academic prose under time pressure

You are not graded on opinions or specialized knowledge. Like Quant and Verbal, AWA rewards:

> Correct reasoning + clear structure + disciplined execution

**Structure of the AWA Section**

- Issue Task: Present and defend a position on a general claim
- Argument Task: Critically evaluate the logic of a given argument

Each task is scored 0–6 in half-point increments, using ETS’s published rubrics.


## Issue Task — Constructing an Argument

You are asked to take a position on a broadly stated issue and defend it using reasoning and examples.

This mirrors:

- Quant: Choosing a method and justifying steps
- Verbal (RC): Identifying a main claim and supporting it with evidence

ETS is testing:

- Your ability to reason from principles
- Your ability to qualify claims (not overgeneralize)
- Your ability to organize ideas logically

## Argument Task — Evaluating an Argument

You are given a short argument and asked to analyze its logical flaws, not to agree or disagree with the conclusion.

This mirrors:

- Quantitative Comparison: Testing assumptions by changing variables
- Verbal (RC): Identifying unsupported inferences and weak evidence

ETS is testing:

- Your ability to spot assumptions
- Your ability to explain why reasoning is flawed
- Your ability to propose what evidence would strengthen the argument

## Skills Tested & Scoring Criteria
High-Scoring (5–6) Responses Demonstrate:

| Skill                    | AWA Equivalent              | Quant / Verbal Parallel   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Logical consistency      | Claims follow from premises | Algebraic validity        |
| Evidence-based reasoning | Examples support claims     | Data interpretation       |
| Precision                | Clear, qualified language   | Answer choice elimination |
| Structure                | Clear paragraph roles       | Step-by-step solutions    |
| Critical evaluation      | Identifying assumptions     | RC inference questions    |

**Important:** Stylistic elegance is secondary. Logical clarity is primary.


## Issue Task Strategy
### 1. Developing a Position

You may:

- Agree
- Disagree
- Partially agree (often strongest)

High scorers avoid absolute claims unless the prompt explicitly demands them.

**Quant Parallel:** Just as “x > 0” limits conclusions in QC, real-world claims require conditions.

### 2. Structuring the Essay

A strong Issue essay follows a logical progression, not a memorized template:
1. Introduction
    - Rephrase the issue
    - State a clear, defensible thesis
    - Indicate scope (conditions or limits)
2. Body Paragraphs (2–3)
    - One central claim per paragraph
    - Explanation → example → analysis
    - Explicit link back to thesis
3. Counterargument (often embedded)
    - Acknowledge a reasonable objection
    - Explain why it is limited or conditional
4. Conclusion
    - Reinforce thesis without repetition
    - Emphasize reasoning, not emotion


### 3. Using Examples Effectively

Strong examples are:

- Specific but not obscure
- Historical, academic, institutional, or hypothetical
- Directly tied to the claim

Weak examples:

- Personal anecdotes
- Vague references (“many people believe…”)

**Verbal Parallel:**
Like RC questions, examples must directly support the claim, not merely relate to the topic.

## Argument Task Strategy
### 1. Identify the Conclusion and Evidence

Before criticizing, map the argument:

- What is the conclusion?
- What evidence supports it?
- What assumptions connect them?

This is equivalent to identifying:

- Premise → inference → conclusion

### 2. Common Logical Flaws to Target
| Flaw                     | Description                             | Quant Analogy        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Unstated assumption      | Missing link between evidence and claim | Undefined variable   |
| Causation vs correlation | Assumes cause without proof             | Misapplied formula   |
| Sample bias              | Unrepresentative data                   | Invalid test case    |
| Oversimplification       | Ignores alternatives                    | Ignoring constraints |

### 3. Suggest Improvements

High-scoring responses do not stop at criticism. They explain:

- What additional evidence is needed
- What alternative explanations should be tested

**Quant Parallel:** Like checking multiple values in QC to confirm a relationship.

## Logical Parallels to Quant and Verbal
**Quant → AWA**

- Define variables → define terms
- Test boundary cases → consider counterexamples
- Justify steps → explain reasoning

**Verbal → AWA**

- Identify main idea → thesis
- Evaluate evidence → analyze assumptions
- Track structure → paragraph coherence

Key Insight: AWA is argument-based reasoning, not creative writing.

## Step-by-Step Writing Framework
**Planning (1–2 Minutes)**

- Identify task type
- Write:
    - Issue: thesis + 2 reasons
    - Argument: conclusion + 2–3 flaws

**Writing (Main Time)**

- One idea per paragraph
- Explicit logical transitions:
    - “This reasoning assumes…”
    - “However, this conclusion depends on…”

**Revising (Final 1–2 Minutes)**

Check:

- Clear thesis
- Topic sentences
- Logical flow
- Grammar and clarity


## High-Scoring Techniques
**Thesis Construction**

- Specific, conditional, defensible
- Avoid absolute claims unless justified

**Cohesive Paragraphs**

Each paragraph should answer:
> What am I claiming, and why does it matter?

**Transitions**

Use logic-based transitions, not decorative ones:

- “As a result…”
- “This assumption fails because…”

**Vocabulary & Syntax**

- Precise, not ornamental
- Sentence variety without verbosity
- Avoid memorized phrases
