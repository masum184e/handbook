Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for building fast and SEO-friendly web applications.

## Key Features

- **Hybrid Rendering (SSR + SSG)** – It allows both Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) for better performance and SEO.
- **Automatic Code Splitting** – It loads only the necessary JavaScript for each page, improving performance.
- **File-based Routing** – Each file in the `pages/` or `app/` directory automatically becomes a route.
- **Built-in API Routes** – You can create backend endpoints using `pages/api/` or `app/api`.
- **Optimized Images** – It provides an `next/image` component for efficient image handling.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)** – Updates static content without rebuilding the entire app.
- **Middleware & Edge Functions** – For handling custom requests before they reach API endpoints.

## Why Use Next.js?

Next.js is used because it offers better performance, SEO, and developer experience compared to plain React apps. Here’s why:

1. **Improved SEO**
   - Traditional React apps use Client-Side Rendering (CSR), where content is generated in the browser. This makes it difficult for search engines to index the page.
   - Next.js uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) to deliver pre-rendered HTML, making it SEO-friendly.
2. **Faster Page Loads**
   - Since pages are pre-rendered or served from the server, they load faster.
   - Automatic code-splitting ensures users only download what's needed.
3. **Built-in Routing System**
   - No need to install React Router; Next.js handles routing based on the `pages/` or `app/` folder structure.
4. **API Routes (Full Stack Capabilities)**
   - With `pages/api/` or `app/api/`, Next.js can handle backend logic without needing an external server.
5. **Scalability & Flexibility**
   - Supports static generation, server rendering, and hybrid models based on project needs.

## Comparison

React is a JavaScript library for building UI components, while Next.js is a framework built on top of React that provides extra features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.

### Fetching Data With - React

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []);

  if (!data) return <p>Loading...</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>React App</h1>
      <p>{data.title}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Downsides of React (CSR)**

- The page loads without content initially (bad for SEO).
- JavaScript must execute before data is displayed.
- Slower time to first paint (TTFP).

### Fetching Data With - Next.js

```tsx
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  const data = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1").then(
    (res) => res.json()
  );

  return {
    props: { todo: data },
  };
}

export default function Home({ todo }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Next.js App</h1>
      <p>{todo.title}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Benefits of Next.js (SSR)**

- Pre-rendered content → Better for SEO.
- No loading state → Content is available immediately.
- Fast Time to First Paint (TTFP).
