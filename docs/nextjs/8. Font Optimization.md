**Why Fonts Matter for Performance**

- Custom fonts can block text rendering → causing FOIT (Flash of Invisible Text) or FOUT (Flash of Unstyled Text).
- Fonts are often large and loaded from third-party CDNs (Google Fonts, etc.), which adds network latency.

**What `next/font` Does**

- Self-hosts fonts (no external CDN calls).
- Automatic font optimization (only loads used subsets/styles).
- Prevents CLS by injecting correct fallback fonts.
- Works with:
  - Google Fonts: `next/font/google`
  - Local fonts: `next/font/local`

```ts
const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  weight: ["400", "700"],
  display: "swap", // Fallback text until font loads
});
```

- No extra network call to Google Fonts → fonts are bundled and served from your app.
- Automatic `font-display: swap` ensures fallback text is shown → improves perceived speed and avoids layout shift.
