Coupling refers to the degree of dependency between modules or components in a system. It determines how much one module relies on another.

There are two types of coupling:

1. Tight Coupling (High Coupling)
2. Loose Coupling (Low Coupling)

## Tight Coupling (High Coupling)

When one module is highly dependent on another, changes in one module will affect the other.

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started...");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car() {
        this.engine = new Engine(); // Direct dependency on Engine
    }

    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- Here, `Car` directly creates an instance of `Engine`, meaning `Car` is tightly coupled to `Engine`.
- If we want to change the `Engine` class (e.g., introduce a new type of engine), we must modify the `Car` class.
- This reduces flexibility and makes the system hard to maintain.

## Loose Coupling (Low Coupling)

When modules interact with minimal dependency, making the system more maintainable and flexible.

```java
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine started...");
    }
}

// Using Dependency Injection
class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    public Car(Engine engine) { // Injecting dependency
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    void drive() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car is moving...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine engine = new Engine();
        Car car = new Car(engine); // Injecting the Engine instance
        car.drive();
    }
}
```

**Explanation**

- Now `Car` does not create an instance of `Engine`; instead, it accepts an `Engine` object via the constructor.
- This follows Dependency Injection (DI), making `Car` loosely coupled to `Engine`.
- If we change `Engine`, we don’t need to modify `Car`.
