It describe the structure of a system by showing its classes, attributes, methods, and the relationships between them.

#### Components

- **Class:** The basic building block of a class diagram, representing a blueprint of an object in the system. A class is typically depicted as a rectangle divided into three sections:
  - **Class Name:** The top section contains the class name, usually written in bold.
  - **Attributes:** The middle section lists the data members or properties of the class.
  - **Methods:** The bottom section lists the functions or operations that the class can perform.
- **Attributes:** The data stored within a class (also known as fields or properties). Attributes have types (e.g., String, Integer) and can have visibility modifiers:
  - Public (`+`): Can be accessed from outside the class.
  - Private (`-`): Can only be accessed within the class.
  - Protected (`#`): Can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.
- **Methods:** The operations or functions a class can perform. Like attributes, methods can also have visibility modifiers. Methods define the behavior of the class and typically manipulate its attributes.
- **Relationships between Classes:**
  - **Association:** A general relationship between two classes. It can be unidirectional or bidirectional(A `Member` can borrow multiple `Book`, and a `Book` can be borrowed by multiple `Member` (over time)). It is represented by a line between the classes followed by an arrow that navigates the direction, and when the arrow is on both sides, it is then called a bidirectional association. We can specify the multiplicity of an association by adding the adornments on the line that will denote the association.
  - **Multiplicity:** Defines how many instances of one class can be associated with instances of another class (e.g., 1..\*, 0..1).
  - **Inheritance (Generalization):** A "is-a" relationship where a subclass inherits from a parent class(`Member` and `Librarian` classes can inherit from a common base class called `Person` since both share attributes like name, contact information, etc).
  - **Aggregation:** A "has-a" relationship where one class is composed of another class but can exist independently.(`Library` "has" multiple `Section`.) It is represented by a straight line with an empty diamond at one end.
  - **Composition:** A stronger form of aggregation where the contained class cannot exist independently(The `Library` consists of `Book`. If the library is closed or removed, the books associated with it are also gone, so this is a strong composition relationship. The library is responsible for maintaining the collection of books). It is represented by a straight line with a black diamond at one end.
  - **Dependency:** A weaker relationship indicating that one class depends on another, but only temporarily(A `Member` depends on `BorrowTransaction` to borrow or return books. )

| Association relationship is represented using an arrow.                                                         | Aggregation relationship is represented by a straight line with an empty diamond at one end.                                                    | The composition relationship is represented by a straight line with a black diamond at one end.                                                                     |
| In UML, it can exist between two or more classes.                                                               | It is a part of the association relationship.                                                                                                   | It is a part of the aggregation relationship.                                                                                                                       |
| It incorporates one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many association between the classes.         | It exhibits a kind of weak relationship.                                                                                                        | It exhibits a strong type of relationship.                                                                                                                          |
| It can associate one more objects together.                                                                     | In an aggregation relationship, the associated objects exist independently within the scope of the system.                                      | In a composition relationship, the associated objects cannot exist independently within the scope of the system.                                                    |
| In this, objects are linked together.                                                                           | In this, the linked objects are independent of each other.                                                                                      | Here the linked objects are dependent on each other.                                                                                                                |
| It may or may not affect the other associated element if one element is deleted.                                | Deleting one element in the aggregation relationship does not affect other associated elements.                                                 | It affects the other element if one of its associated element is deleted.                                                                                           |
| **Example**: A tutor can associate with multiple students, or one student can associate with multiple teachers. | **Example**: A car needs a wheel for its proper functioning, but it may not require the same wheel. It may function with another wheel as well. | **Example**: If a file is placed in a folder and that folder is deleted, the file residing inside that folder will also get deleted at the time of folder deletion. |
