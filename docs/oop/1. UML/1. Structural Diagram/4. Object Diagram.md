It shows a snapshot of the objects at a particular point in time, their states, and their relationships. Similar to class diagrams, but shows actual instances (objects) rather than class definitions.

**Syntax:**

```
+------------------------+
| objectName : ClassName |
+------------------------+
|   attributes = value   |
+------------------------+
```

**Example:**

```
+-----------------+           +------------------+
|    Library1     |           |  Member1: John    |
+-----------------+           +------------------+
| name: CityLib   |           | name: John Doe    |
| address: City A |           | membershipId: 123 |
+-----------------+           +------------------+
                Library1 has Member1 (object relationship)
```
