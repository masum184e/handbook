It is a structural diagram that shows how components are connected and how they interact to form larger software systems. It visualizes the organization and dependencies among a set of components.

**What is a Component?**

A component represents a modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces. In simpler terms, components are self-contained units that can be replaced independently.

#### Components

1. **Component:**

- A self-contained module with well-defined functionality, like a class, module, or microservice.
- Represented as a rectangle with the stereotype «component».
  ```
  +------------------------+
  |      «component»       |
  |    Book Management     |
  +------------------------+
  ```

2. **Interface:**

- Defines how components communicate—what services they provide and require.
- Types:
  - Provided Interface (lollipop-○): what a component offers.
  - Required Interface (socket-◐): what a component needs.

3. **Relationships:**

- Dependency (dashed arrow): One component depends on another.
- Association (solid line): A structural link.
- Assembly Connector: Connects required to provided interfaces.

4. **Ports:**

- Interaction point on the boundary of a component.
- Represented as small square on the component’s edge.

5. **Artifacts:**

- A physical file or piece of code/data
- Real-world outputs like executable files or data.
- Shown as rectangles with «artifact».

6. **Nodes:**

- Physical/virtual environments where components run.
- Shown as 3D boxes.

**Example:**
