It represents workflows and the sequence of activities. It define what activities user perform during a use case.

Each use case in a use case diagram can be further explored by creating an activity diagram. It's common to create an activity diagram for each use case identified in the use case diagram.

**Components:**

- **Activities:** Represent tasks or actions performed in the workflow. Each activity is denoted by a rounded rectangle.
- **Start Node:** Indicates the beginning of a process. It is represented by a filled black circle.
- **End Node:** Marks the end of the process flow. It is represented by a black circle with a surrounding border.
- **Transitions/Arrows:** Arrows show the flow or transition from one activity to the next.
- **Decision Node:** Depicted as a diamond shape, it represents branching in the workflow based on conditions. Each outgoing arrow is labeled with a condition.
- **Merge Node:** A diamond shape without conditions where multiple flows join back together.
- **Fork Node:** Represented as a thick horizontal or vertical line, it splits a single flow into multiple parallel flows.
- **Join Node:** A thick line that synchronizes multiple parallel flows into a single flow.
- **Swimlanes:** Vertical or horizontal partitions used to organize activities by the responsible actors or departments. This helps in visually associating actions with particular actors.
