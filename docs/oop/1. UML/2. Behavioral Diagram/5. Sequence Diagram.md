It shows how objects interact in a time-sequenced manner. It captures the flow of messages between objects or components, representing their interactions in a time-ordered sequence. Sequence diagrams are often used to model the logic of methods, functions, and use cases, especially to show how various parts of a system collaborate.

**Components:**

- **Actors/Objects:** Represent the entities (objects, users, or external systems) that interact in the scenario.
- **Lifelines:** Vertical dashed lines that represent the life span of an object during the interaction.
- **Activation Bars:** Thicker vertical rectangles(**not dashed**) along a lifeline showing the time an object is active and performing a task.
- **Messages:** Horizontal arrows between lifelines that represent communication (method calls, responses, or signals). These can be:
  - **Synchronous** (solid line with a filled arrowhead): Represents a call where the sender waits for a response.
  - **Asynchronous** (solid line with an open arrowhead): Represents a call where the sender does not wait for a response.
  - **Return Messages** (dashed line): Represents the return of control or data from the receiver back to the sender.
