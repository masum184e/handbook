It represents the system's functional requirements from an end-user's perspective and the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and a system to achieve specific goals. It gather the system needs and depicts the external view of the system.

**Components:**

- **Actors:** External entities (users, systems) that interact with the system.
- **Use Cases:** Functions or services the system provides.
- **Relationships:** Shows how actors interact with use cases.
  - **Association:** Connects actors to use cases, indicating that an actor participates in a use case.
  - **Include:** A relationship where a use case is always included as part of another use case.
  - **Extend:** Indicates optional behavior that extends the functionality of a use case.
- **System Boundary:** Defines the scope of the system being modeled.
