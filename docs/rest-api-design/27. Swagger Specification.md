**OpenAPI Specification (OAS)**

The OpenAPI Specification is a machine-readable standard for describing REST APIs.
It defines how an API works, not how it is implemented.

- Formerly known as Swagger Specification
- Maintained by the OpenAPI Initiative (OAI)
- Current widely used versions: OpenAPI 3.0.x and 3.1

**Swagger**

Swagger refers to a tooling ecosystem built around OpenAPI:

- Swagger UI – Interactive API documentation
- Swagger Editor – Write & validate OpenAPI specs
- Swagger Codegen / OpenAPI Generator – Generate client/server code

OpenAPI = specification (standard)

Swagger = tools that use the specification

## Documentation

OpenAPI acts as a single source of truth for API documentation:

- Endpoints
- HTTP methods
- Request parameters
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication mechanisms
- Error responses

This documentation:

- Is always in sync with the API
- Can be automatically generated
- Is interactive (try requests directly)

## Discoverability

Discoverability answers the question:

> “How do developers find out what this API can do?”

OpenAPI improves discoverability by:

- Listing all available endpoints
- Clearly defining input/output formats
- Providing examples
- Supporting self-service onboarding

Developers can explore the API without reading external docs or source code.

## Key Components of an OpenAPI Specification

An OpenAPI document is usually written in YAML or JSON.

High-level structure

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.3
info:
paths:
components:
security:
```

      parameters:

        id:
          type: integer
          example: 1
        name:

    UserCreate:
      type: object

        name:
          type: string
          example: Jane Doe
        email:

- `openapi`: Specifies the OpenAPI version being used.
- `info`: Provides human-readable metadata, Critical for documentation portals.
- `servers`: Defines where the API is hosted. Helps tools know where to send requests.
- `paths`: Each path represents a resource.
  Each HTTP method includes:
  - `summary` → Short description
  - `description` → Detailed explanation
  - `tags` → Logical grouping
  - `responses` → Output definitions

### Request Body (POST)

```yaml
requestBody:
  required: true
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        $ref: "#/components/schemas/UserCreate"
```

- Defines what clients must send
- Schema ensures validation
- Improves discoverability of required fields

### Parameters

```yaml
parameters:
  - name: id
    in: path
    required: true
```

Explains:

- Parameter location (`path`, `query`, `header`)
- Data type
- Whether it’s required

### Responses

```yaml
responses:
  "200":
    description: User found
```

Each response includes:

- HTTP status code
- Meaning
- Content type
- Schema

This removes ambiguity for API consumers.

### Components & Schemas

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
```

Reusable models:

- Prevent duplication
- Ensure consistency
- Enable code generation

## Tools That Use OpenAPI

| Tool              | Purpose                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Swagger UI        | Interactive API documentation |
| Swagger Editor    | Write & validate specs        |
| OpenAPI Generator | Client/server SDK generation  |
| Postman           | Import & test APIs            |
| Stoplight         | API design & governance       |

OpenAPI/Swagger is essential for REST API documentation and discoverability because it:

- Standardizes API descriptions
- Enables automatic, interactive documentation
- Makes APIs self-describing
- Reduces onboarding time
- Improves consistency and maintainability

Well-designed REST APIs are not just usable — they are discoverable, and OpenAPI makes that possible.
