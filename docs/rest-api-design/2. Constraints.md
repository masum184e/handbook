## 1. Client-Server Architecture

**Definition:**

The client (consumer) and server (provider) must be separate entities, each responsible for its own concerns.

- The client handles the user interface and user interactions.
- The server manages data, business logic, and processing.

**Benefits:**

- Independent development of client and server
- Easier scaling and deployment

**Example:**

A mobile app (client) calls `GET /books` to fetch book data from the API (server). The app doesn’t need to know how the server stores data—just how to request and display it.

## 2. Statelessness

**Definition:**

Each client request must contain all necessary information for the server to understand and process it.
The server should not store any session state between requests.

**Benefits:**

- Scalability (easier to distribute load across servers)
- Simplifies server logic

**Example:**

When calling `GET /orders/1001`, the client must include authentication info (like a token) with every request:

```shell
GET /orders/1001
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
```

The server doesn’t store session data — each request is processed independently.

## 3. Cacheability

**Definition:**

Responses must explicitly indicate whether they are cacheable (and for how long) using HTTP headers.

**Benefits:**

- Reduces server load
- Improves client performance

**Example:**

A response from `GET /books` might include:

```shell
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
```

This tells clients and proxies they can cache the response for 1 hour.

## 4. Uniform Interface

**Definition:**

REST APIs must have a standardized way of communicating between client and server. This is the core constraint that differentiates REST from other architectures.

**Principles of Uniform Interface:**

1. **Resource Identification:** Use URIs to identify resources (e.g., `/books/10`)
2. **Standard HTTP Methods:**

   - `GET` to retrieve
   - `POST` to create
   - `PUT` to update
   - `DELETE` to remove

3. **Representation of Resources:** Resources are sent in formats like JSON or XML.

4. **Self-descriptive Messages:** Requests and responses contain enough information (e.g., headers like `Content-Type`)

**Example:**

```shell
GET /books/10
Accept: application/json
```

**Server Response:**

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "title": "RESTful Web Services",
  "author": "Leonard Richardson"
}
```

## 5. Layered System

**Definition:**

A REST API must be designed in layers, where each layer has a specific responsibility.
Clients cannot tell whether they’re connected directly to the server or through intermediaries (like load balancers or caches).

**Benefits:**

- Scalability via load balancing, caching, proxies
- Improved security and modularity

**Example:**

A client sends a request to `api.example.com`, which is routed through:

- a load balancer,
- then to an API gateway,
- then to a service running the actual logic.

The client is unaware of these layers.

## 6. Code on Demand (Optional)

**Definition:**

Servers can optionally send executable code to clients, allowing them to extend functionality.

**Benefits:**

- Flexibility
- Offloads processing to the client

**Example:**

The server responds with JavaScript code that runs on the client’s browser:

```shell
Content-Type: application/javascript
```

Client uses this script to render charts, validate forms, etc.

This is the only optional constraint. Most REST APIs do not use this in practice.
