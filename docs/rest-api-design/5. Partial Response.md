Partial Response is a REST API design technique where clients can request only specific fields or properties of a resource rather than the entire resource.
This reduces unnecessary data transfer, improving performance and efficiency—especially in cases where resources have many attributes, but the client only needs a few.

## Why Partial Response Matters

- **Performance:** Reduces payload size and speeds up response time.
- **Bandwidth Efficiency:** Especially important for mobile or limited-bandwidth environments.
- **Flexibility:** Gives clients more control over the data they receive.

## How Partial Response Works

Partial response is usually implemented using query parameters like `fields`.
The client specifies which fields they want by passing them in the request:

```shell
GET /users/123?fields=id,name,email
```

The server parses the `fields` parameter and returns only those fields in the response.

## Example of Partial Response

Imagine a `User` resource with many fields:

```json
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "phone": "123-456-7890",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-06-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

A client only needs `id`, `name`, and `email`.

**Request Example:**

```shell
GET /users/123?fields=id,name,email
```

## How to implement partial response

1. **Parse Query Parameter:** Extract the fields value from the query string.
2. **Validate Fields:** Ensure the requested fields exist in the resource model and that the client has permission to access them.
3. **Dynamically Build Response:** Use techniques like object filtering or projection in your backend language to send only the specified fields.

```js
app.get("/users/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const fields = req.query.fields ? req.query.fields.split(",") : null;
  const user = await getUserFromDB(req.params.id);

  if (!fields) {
    return res.json(user);
  }

  const partialUser = {};
  fields.forEach((field) => {
    if (user[field] !== undefined) {
      partialUser[field] = user[field];
    }
  });

  res.json(partialUser);
});
```

## Best Practices of partial response

- **Security:** Be careful not to expose sensitive fields accidentally.
- **Field Whitelisting:** Only allow fields that are explicitly permitted.
- **Default Behavior:** If no fields parameter is provided, return all fields (or a default subset).
- **Tooling Support:** Some libraries/frameworks offer automatic support for partial response, especially in GraphQL or with ORM libraries.
