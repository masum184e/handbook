## Non-Breaking Change

A non-breaking change is any update to the API that does not require existing clients to change their behavior or implementation. Existing clients continue to work as expected.

### Example of Non-Breaking Change

| Scenario                              | Why It's Non-Breaking                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Adding a new optional field           | Clients can ignore fields they don't recognize. |
| Adding a new endpoint                 | Clients using old endpoints remain unaffected.  |
| Extending enum values                 | Clients can default to ignoring unknown values. |
| Increasing a limit (e.g., pagination) | Clients using previous limits still function.   |

#### Example: Adding a New Field

Old Response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

New Response(Non-Breaking)

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice",
  "nickname": "Ally"
}
```

Why it's non-breaking: Existing clients that don't expect `nickname` will simply ignore it.

## Breaking Change

A breaking change is any modification that requires existing clients to change their code in order to continue functioning properly.

### Example of Breaking Changes

| Scenario                               | Why It's Breaking                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Removing an existing field             | Clients depending on it may break.               |
| Renaming a field                       | Client parsing will fail.                        |
| Changing a field’s data type           | Data may be incompatible.                        |
| Changing URL structure or HTTP methods | Clients using hardcoded URLs/methods will break. |
| Changing authentication mechanism      | Clients using the old auth method fail.          |

#### Example: Renaming a Field

Old Response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

New Response(Breaking)

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "fullName": "Alice"
}
```

Why it's breaking: Existing clients looking for `name` will no longer find it and may throw errors.
