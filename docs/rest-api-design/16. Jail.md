Jail is a longer-term or permanent block applied when repeated abusive behavior is detected. It’s often triggered by:

- Multiple max retry violations
- Suspicious or bot-like login patterns
- Known bad IP addresses

**Why Use Jail?**

- Protect against persistent attackers
- Limit abuse from automated scripts
- Enforce stricter penalties after repeated offenses

**Example Jail Policy:**
| Parameter | Value |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Max Retry per Window | 5 attempts |
| Max Violations (in 24h) | 3 violations |
| Jail Duration | 24 hours (or permanent for IP) |
