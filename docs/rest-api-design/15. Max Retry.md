Max retry defines the maximum number of failed login attempts a user (or IP) can make within a certain time window. After exceeding this limit, further attempts are blocked temporarily or permanently, depending on policy.

**Why Use Max Retry?**

- Prevent brute-force attacks
- Protect user accounts
- Reduce load on authentication systems

**Example Settings:**
| Parameter | Value |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Max Retry Count | 5 attempts |
| Time Window | 15 minutes |
| Block Duration | 30 minutes |
