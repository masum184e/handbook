## Permission-Based Access Control

- Instead of broad roles, access is controlled by specific permissions (privileges).
- Permissions are fine-grained (e.g., `post:read`, `post:create`, `post:delete`).
- Users can have multiple permissions, either directly or via roles.

### How PBAC Works

1. User authenticates → JWT contains a list of permissions.
2. API checks whether required permission is present.

### PBAC in REST API

JWT Payload

```json
{
  "sub": "123",
  "name": "Masum Billah",
  "permissions": ["post:read", "post:create", "post:update"],
  "exp": 1736790400
}
```

Request (User trying to delete a post)

```bash
DELETE /posts/42 HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1...
```

Server Check

- Extract permissions: [`"post:read"`, `"post:create"`, `"post:update"`]
- Required permission: `post:delete`
- User does not have it → return `403 Forbidden`

Response

```json
{
  "error": "Missing required permission: post:delete"
}
```

### RBAC vs PBAC

| Feature            | RBAC (Role-Based)   | PBAC (Permission-Based)                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Granularity        | Coarse (role level) | Fine-grained (action level)                 |
| Example Assignment | `role = editor`     | `permissions = ["post:read","post:update"]` |
| Easy to Manage     | ✅ (fewer roles)    | ❌ (many permissions)                       |
| Flexibility        | ❌ Limited          | ✅ Very flexible                            |
| Use Case           | Small/medium apps   | Large systems with many actions             |
