## Agent Based

An agent in API management is an autonomous or semi-autonomous program that:

- Interprets policies or rules
- Monitors API usage
- Takes actions (e.g., throttling, caching, logging, alerting)
- May use AI/ML or decision trees to optimize or modify API behavior

Agents typically reside in:

- API gateways (like Kong, Apigee, or AWS API Gateway)
- Middleware platforms
- Sidecars in service meshes (e.g., Envoy in Istio)
- Client SDKs (for offline handling, caching, retries)

## Proxy Based

A proxy is an intermediary between clients and servers. In API management, a reverse proxy is used to:

- Accept client requests
- Apply policies (security, rate limits, etc.)
- Forward valid requests to the backend services
- Log, monitor, and transform traffic as needed

A proxy-based API manager often acts like a traffic cop, enforcing rules before requests hit the actual API services.

### Common Proxy-based API Gateways

| Tool                | Type        | Features                              |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Kong**            | OSS & Cloud | Plugins, rate limiting, auth, logging |
| **Apigee**          | Cloud       | Policies, analytics, monetization     |
| **AWS API Gateway** | Cloud       | Lambda auth, usage plans, CORS        |
| **Nginx/OpenResty** | Self-hosted | Scripting, reverse proxy, caching     |
| **Tyk**             | OSS & Cloud | JWT, auth, quotas, caching            |

## Proxy vs Agent-Based API Management

| Feature                 | Proxy-Based API Management | Agent-Based API Management     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Central control point   | ✅ Yes                     | ⚠️ Not always centralized      |
| Requires client support | ❌ No                      | ✅ Sometimes (e.g. SDK agent)  |
| Latency impact          | ✅ Slight (adds hop)       | ✅ or ❌ (depends on location) |
| Extensibility           | ✅ via plugins             | ✅ via scripts or AI logic     |
| Offline behavior        | ❌ Cannot handle           | ✅ Client-side agent can       |
