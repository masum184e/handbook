The Richardson Maturity Model (RMM) is a model developed by Leonard Richardson to evaluate how well a web API follows REST principles. It defines four levels (0 to 3), each building on the previous one, showing the maturity of an API in terms of its RESTful characteristics.

| Level | Description                       | Key Features                                                  |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | **The Swamp of POX**              | Single URI, uses HTTP as a transport tunnel (often only POST) |
| 1     | **Resources**                     | Exposes multiple URIs (endpoints) for resources               |
| 2     | **HTTP Verbs**                    | Uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE        |
| 3     | **Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)** | Uses hyperlinks in responses to guide client interaction      |

## Level 0: The Swamp of POX (Plain Old XML)

**Description:**

- Single URI (`/api`)
- Only uses `POST` for every action
- Request tells the server what to do using action names (RPC-style)
- Often uses XML or JSON, but not in a RESTful way

**Example:**

```json
POST /api
{
  "action": "getBook",
  "bookId": 123
}
```

**Problems:**

- No use of HTTP verbs
- No resource-based URIs
- Violates REST constraints

## Level 1: Resources

**Description:**

- Exposes multiple URIs to represent resources (e.g., `/books`, `/authors`)
- Still may use only `POST`

**Example:**

```json
POST /books/get
{
  "id": 123
}
```

**Improvements:**

- Introduces the concept of resources
- Each resource has its own URI

**Still Lacking:**

- Proper use of HTTP verbs (e.g., still using `POST` for everything)

## Level 2: HTTP Verbs

**Description:**

Uses HTTP methods properly:

- `GET` for retrieving
- `POST` for creating
- `PUT` for updating
- `DELETE` for deleting

Also uses standard HTTP status codes (`200`, `201`, `404`, etc.)

**Example:**

```shell
GET /books/123           → Get a book
POST /books              → Create a book
PUT /books/123           → Update a book
DELETE /books/123        → Delete a book
```

**Improvements:**

- Fully leverages the capabilities of HTTP
- Improves clarity, scalability, and cacheability

**Still Lacking:**

- No discovery or navigation via hyperlinks

## Level 3: Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)

**HATEOAS = Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State**

**Description:**

- The API provides hyperlinks in responses
- Clients can discover available actions by following links
- Fully REST-compliant
- Promotes decoupling and flexibility

**Example:**

```json
GET /books/123

Response:
{
  "id": 123,
  "title": "RESTful Web Services",
  "author": "Leonard Richardson",
  "_links": {
    "self": { "href": "/books/123" },
    "update": { "href": "/books/123", "method": "PUT" },
    "delete": { "href": "/books/123", "method": "DELETE" },
    "author": { "href": "/authors/7" }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

- Client doesn’t need to hardcode URIs or workflows
- Server guides the client like a human browsing a website
- Ideal for long-term evolution and discoverability

## Summary of Richardson Maturity Levels

| Level | URI Structure | HTTP Verbs | Hypermedia (HATEOAS) | RESTful?     |
| ----- | ------------- | ---------- | -------------------- | ------------ |
| 0     | No            | No         | No                   | ❌           |
| 1     | ✅            | No         | No                   | ❌           |
| 2     | ✅            | ✅         | No                   | ✅ (Partial) |
| 3     | ✅            | ✅         | ✅                   | ✅ (Full)    |

- Most real-world REST APIs are at Level 2 — they use URIs and HTTP verbs correctly but often skip HATEOAS.
- Level 3 is ideal for discoverability and hypermedia-driven clients, but it requires more complexity and isn't always necessary.
