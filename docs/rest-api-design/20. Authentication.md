## Digest Authentication

- Digest Auth improves on Basic Auth by avoiding sending raw credentials.
- Instead, it uses hashing with a nonce (number used once) to prove identity.
- Password is never sent directly — the server challenges the client, and the client responds with a hashed value.

### How It Works

1. Initial request → Client sends a request without credentials.

2. Server challenge → Server responds with `401 Unauthorized` and a `WWW-Authenticate` header containing:

- A realm (scope of protection).
- A nonce (unique random string).
- The hashing algorithm.

```bash
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="example.com",
                  qop="auth",
                  nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093",
                  opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"
```

3. Client response → Client uses the nonce, username, password, and request details to create a hashed response and resends the request with an `Authorization: Digest` header.

```bash
GET /user/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Digest username="masum",
               realm="example.com",
               nonce="dcd98b7102dd2f0e8b11d0f600bfb0c093",
               uri="/user/profile",
               response="6629fae49393a05397450978507c4ef1",
               opaque="5ccc069c403ebaf9f0171e9517f40e41"
```

4. Server verification → The server calculates the same hash and compares it.

- If it matches → grant access.
- If not → reject.

**Digest Auth Example Explained**

The response value is typically an MD5 hash of:

```scss
MD5( username:realm:password ) + MD5( method:uri ) + nonce
```

This way, the password is never transmitted directly.
