In REST, a self-descriptive message is a request or response that contains all the information needed to understand and process it, without relying on out-of-band documentation.

This is one of Roy Fielding’s core REST constraints.

> A client should be able to understand what the message means and how to process it just by reading the message itself.

## What Makes a Message Self-Descriptive

A REST message is self-descriptive when it includes:

| Element           | Purpose                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| HTTP method       | Intent (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) |
| Media type        | How to interpret payload        |
| Headers           | Metadata & processing rules     |
| Status codes      | Outcome semantics               |
| Body              | Resource representation         |
| Links / relations | Navigation & actions            |

## Non-Self-Descriptive vs Self-Descriptive

### Non-Self-Descriptive

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": 1,
  "data": "ok"
}
```

- Meaning of `status: 1` unclear
- No semantic hints
- Requires external documentation

### Self-Descriptive

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-cache

{
  "id": 42,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

- HTTP status conveys success
- Media type tells how to parse content
- Field names describe meaning

## Media Types & Self-Descriptiveness

Custom or structured media types increase clarity:

```sh
Content-Type: application/vnd.example.user+json
```

This explicitly states: Domain (example), Resource (user), Format (json)

This improves: Semantic understanding, Discoverability, Evolution/versioning
