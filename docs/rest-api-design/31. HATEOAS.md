HATEOAS is a REST constraint stating that:

> Clients interact with a REST API entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by the server.

Clients do not hardcode URLs or workflows.

## Core HATEOAS Concepts

| Concept           | Description                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| Links             | URLs to related actions    |
| Rel               | Relationship meaning       |
| State transitions | Valid next actions         |
| Hypermedia format | HAL, JSON:API, Siren, etc. |

## Example Without HATEOAS

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "status": "pending"
}
```

- Client doesn’t know what actions are allowed
- Requires documentation to know next steps

## Example With HATEOAS

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/hal+json

{
  "id": 10,
  "status": "pending",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/orders/10"
    },
    "cancel": {
      "href": "/orders/10/cancel",
      "method": "POST"
    },
    "pay": {
      "href": "/orders/10/pay",
      "method": "POST"
    }
  }
}
```

| Element  | Purpose                |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
| `self`   | Canonical resource URL |
| `cancel` | Allowed action         |
| `pay`    | Valid state transition |
| `method` | How to invoke action   |

## State-Dependent Discoverability

If order is already paid:

```json
{
  "id": 10,
  "status": "paid",
  "_links": {
    "self": {
      "href": "/orders/10"
    },
    "receipt": {
      "href": "/orders/10/receipt"
    }
  }
}
```

## Common HATEOAS Media Types

| Media Type      | Usage                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| HAL             | Simple hypermedia format |
| JSON:API        | Structured, standardized |
| Siren           | Complex workflows        |
| Collection+JSON | Collections & navigation |

## Why HATEOAS Is Often Optional in Practice

**Reasons for Limited Adoption**

- Added complexity
- Client tooling limitations
- Mobile & SPA clients prefer known endpoints
- Well-documented APIs reduce need

**When HATEOAS Is Worth Using**

- Public APIs
- Long-lived APIs
- APIs requiring backward compatibility
- Highly dynamic workflows
