Prisma Studio is the official GUI (Graphical User Interface) database browser that comes with Prisma.
It allows developers to view, edit, and manage data in their database directly from an easy-to-use web interface without writing SQL queries.

It’s like a lightweight admin panel or database client that’s integrated tightly with your Prisma schema.

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Browser will open at `http://localhost:5555`

## Features of Prisma Studio

1. **Data Browsing**
   - View records in a spreadsheet-like table UI.
   - Easily navigate between related records (via relations).
2. **Data Editing**
   - Edit, insert, and delete rows in your database directly from the UI.
   - Provides type-safe editing because it reads the Prisma Schema.
3. **Relation Management**
   - If you have relations (e.g., `User` ↔ `Post`), you can drill into related records.
   - No need to write JOIN queries manually.
4. **Schema Awareness**
   - Prisma Studio understands your models from `schema.prisma`.
   - Ensures you edit data according to constraints and field types.
5. **Convenience**
   - Great for debugging during development.
   - Acts as an alternative to tools like pgAdmin, DBeaver, or MySQL Workbench, but lighter and Prisma-native.
