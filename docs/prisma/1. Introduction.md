## ORM

ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is a tool that allows you to interact with your database using your programming language’s objects instead of writing raw SQL.

- You define models in your code (like `User`, `Post`).
- The ORM maps these models to database tables.
- Instead of writing SQL, you interact with objects (`user.name` instead of `SELECT name FROM users`).

Example (with a traditional ORM like Sequelize or TypeORM in JavaScript):

```ts
// Sequelize ORM
const User = sequelize.define("User", {
  name: DataTypes.STRING,
  email: DataTypes.STRING,
});

const user = await User.create({ name: "Alice", email: "alice@example.com" });
console.log(user.id);
```

This creates a new user in the database. The ORM hides SQL behind objects.

## Query Builder

Query Builders provide a programmatic way to write SQL queries — they don’t map database tables to objects. They make SQL easier to construct dynamically but don’t abstract away the database schema.

```ts
// Knex Query Builder
const users = await knex("users")
  .where({ email: "alice@example.com" })
  .select("id", "name");

console.log(users);
```

Here, you still think in terms of SQL (`select`, `where`, `join`), just written in JS code instead of plain SQL.

## Prisma

Prisma is a next-generation database toolkit that combines the best of both worlds:

- Like an ORM, it generates a strongly-typed client from your database schema.
- Like a Query Builder, it gives you fine-grained control over queries.
- It’s type-safe, meaning if you use TypeScript, Prisma ensures that your queries are correct at compile time.

So Prisma is not just an ORM, not just a query builder — but a modern hybrid that improves developer experience.

## How Prisma is different

| Feature                 | ORM (e.g. Sequelize) | Query Builder (e.g. Knex) | Prisma                   |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Abstraction Level       | High (objects)       | Low (SQL-like)            | Balanced                 |
| Schema Awareness        | Sometimes (manual)   | No                        | Yes (auto-generated)     |
| Type Safety (TS/JS)     | Weak                 | None                      | Strong                   |
| Developer Experience    | Medium               | Medium                    | Excellent                |
| Auto-completion support | Limited              | Limited                   | Full (via Prisma Client) |
