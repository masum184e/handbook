## Data Segment
- Stores global variables and constants.
- Exists for the entire lifetime of the program

```go
var globalCount int = 100 // stored in data segment

func main() {
    fmt.Println(globalCount)
}
```

- `globalCount` is stored in a fixed memory location in the data segment.

## Code Segment


- Stores the compiled binary instructions of your Go program.
- Read-only for safety.
- Rarely manipulated directly by Go developers.
