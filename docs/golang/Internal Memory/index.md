When we talk about "internal memory" in Go (or any language), we’re referring to how data is stored and managed in the computer’s RAM while the program runs.

Go divides internal memory into several important areas:

1. Stack – Small, fast memory used for function calls and local variables.
2. Heap – Larger memory area used for dynamically allocated variables.
3. Data Segment – For global and static variables.
4. Code Segment – Where compiled machine instructions are stored.
