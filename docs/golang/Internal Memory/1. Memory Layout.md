When a Go program runs, memory is roughly divided like this:

```
+---------------------+   <- High memory addresses
|   Command Line Args |
+---------------------+
|   Environment Vars  |
+---------------------+
|       Stack         |  <- Each goroutine has its own stack
+---------------------+
|       Heap          |  <- Shared between all goroutines
+---------------------+
|  Global Variables   |
+---------------------+
|   Program Code      |
+---------------------+   <- Low memory addresses
```
