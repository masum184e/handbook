Every Go program, no matter how big or small, follows a few key rules:

1. **Package Declaration** – Tells Go what “package” this file belongs to.

   - If the program is meant to run directly, the package must be main.

2. **Import Statements** – Brings in other code (libraries) you want to use.

3. **Functions** – Blocks of code that do things.

   - The main function is special: it’s where your program starts running.

4. **Statements & Expressions** – The actual instructions you give the computer

**General Layout:**

```go
package main          // 1. Package declaration

import "fmt"          // 2. Import statement

// 3. Function definition
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!") // 4. Statements
}
```

**Key Points to Remember**

- Go is case-sensitive (`Main` is different from `main`).
- Every executable Go program starts with:
  1. `package main`
  2. `func main() { ... }`
