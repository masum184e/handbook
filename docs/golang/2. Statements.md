**Why the following example breaks**

You wrote:

```go
func main()
{
```

Here’s what the compiler sees:

1. It reads func main()

2. That could be a complete statement (in some contexts), so Go inserts a semicolon:

```go
func main();
{  // ← now this looks like a syntax error
```

3. Now `{` is floating alone, not attached to the function definition — error.

**Correct Way**

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

By putting `{` on the same line, Go doesn’t insert the semicolon after `func main()`.

**Why Go enforces this**

- It keeps code style consistent (Go is opinionated about formatting).
- It works hand-in-hand with the gofmt tool that auto-formats Go code.
