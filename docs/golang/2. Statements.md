A statement is a complete instruction that tells the computer to do something.

Think of it like a sentence in English:

- A sentence = a statement in Go.
- Each statement ends when the line ends (Go automatically inserts semicolons for you, so you don’t type `;` most of the time, does not show up in the source code).

## Automatic Semicolon Insertion

**How it works**

- In most languages, you end a statement with a semicolon `;`.
- In Go, you can write semicolons, but usually you leave them out — the Go compiler automatically adds them at the end of a line when it thinks a statement is finished.

**The rule is:**

- If a line ends with something that can legally end a statement, Go inserts a semicolon there.

**Why the following example breaks**

You wrote:

```go
func main()
{
```

Here’s what the compiler sees:

1. It reads `func main()`

2. That could be a complete statement (in some contexts), so Go inserts a semicolon:

```go
func main();
{  // ← now this looks like a syntax error
```

3. Now `{` is floating alone, not attached to the function definition — error.

**Correct Way**

```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
```

By putting `{` on the same line, Go doesn’t insert the semicolon after `func main()`.

**Why Go enforces this**

- It keeps code style consistent (Go is opinionated about formatting).
- It works hand-in-hand with the go `fmt` tool that auto-formats Go code.
