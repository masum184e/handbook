There are two ways to declare a variable:

1. With the `var` keyword:

```go
var variablename type = value
```

You always have to specify either type or value (or both).

```go
var age int = 25      // type and value
var name string       // type only → defaults to ""
var score = 100       // value only → type inferred as int
```

2. With the `:= sign`

```go
variablename := value
```

In this case, the type of the variable is `inferred` from the value (means that the compiler decides the type of the variable, based on the value).

It is not possible to declare a variable using `:=`, without assigning a value to it.

## Default (Zero) Values

If you declare a variable with var but don’t give a value, Go sets:

- Numbers → `0`
- Strings → `""` (empty string)
- Booleans → `false`
- Pointers, slices, maps, etc. → `nil`
