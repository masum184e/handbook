A struct (short for structure) is a custom data type that lets you group related data together under one name, with named fields.

Think of a struct as:

> A blueprint for an object (without OOP inheritance)

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    age: u32,
}
```

- `User` → struct name
- Fields have names and types
- Groups logically related data

## Key Characteristics of Structs

| Feature    | Struct             |
| ---------- | ------------------ |
| Fields     | Named              |
| Types      | Can be different   |
| Size       | Fixed              |
| Ownership  | Owns its data      |
| Mutability | Optional           |
| Memory     | Stack (by default) |

## Creating Struct Instances

```rust
let user1 = User {
    username: String::from("alice"),
    email: String::from("alice@example.com"),
    age: 25,
};
```

### Mutable Struct

```rust
let mut user2 = User {
    username: String::from("bob"),
    email: String::from("bob@example.com"),
    age: 30,
};

user2.age = 31;
```

📌 Entire instance must be `mut`.

## Accessing Struct Fields

```rust
println!("{}", user1.username);
println!("{}", user1.age);
```

Dot (`.`) notation.

## Struct Update Syntax

```rust
let user3 = User {
    username: String::from("charlie"),
    ..user1
};
```

Reuses remaining fields from `user1`.

Ownership note:

- Fields like `String` are moved
- `user1` may become partially unusable

## Functions Using Structs

### Passing Structs (Borrowing)

```rust
fn print_user(user: &User) {
    println!("{} ({})", user.username, user.age);
}
```

Usage:

```rust
print_user(&user2);
```

### Returning Structs

```rust
fn create_user(name: String, email: String) -> User {
    User {
        username: name,
        email,
        age: 18,
    }
}
```

## Methods and impl Blocks

Adding Methods to Structs

```rust
impl User {
    fn greet(&self) {
        println!("Hello, {}", self.username);
    }
}
```

Usage:

```rust
user2.greet();
```

`&self` borrows the instance.

### Associated Functions (Like Constructors)

```rust
impl User {
    fn new(username: String, email: String) -> User {
        User {
            username,
            email,
            age: 0,
        }
    }
}
```

Usage:

```rust
let user = User::new(
    String::from("dave"),
    String::from("dave@example.com"),
);
```

## Tuple Structs

```rust
struct Color(u8, u8, u8);
```

Usage:

```rust
let red = Color(255, 0, 0);
```

Access:

```rust
println!("{}", red.0);
```

Like tuples but with a name.

## Unit-Like Structs

```rust
struct Marker;
```

Used when:

- You need a type but no data
- Marker traits or configurations

## Structs vs Tuples

| Feature     | Struct       | Tuple              |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| Field names | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No              |
| Readability | High         | Low                |
| Best for    | Complex data | Temporary grouping |

## Ownership and Struct Fields

```rust
struct Book {
    title: String,
    pages: u32,
}

let book1 = Book {
    title: String::from("Rust Book"),
    pages: 500,
};

let book2 = book1;
// book1 is no longer usable
```

Struct follows ownership rules per field.

## Structs with References (Lifetimes)

```rust
struct Article<'a> {
    title: &'a str,
    content: &'a str,
}
```

Used when struct does not own data.
