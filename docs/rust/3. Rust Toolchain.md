In Rust, a toolchain is a set of tools that work together to compile, build, manage, and run Rust programs.

## The Core Rust Toolchain Includes:

| Tool       | Purpose                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `rustc`    | Rust compiler                  |
| `cargo`    | Package manager & build system |
| `rust-std` | Standard library               |
| `rustup`   | Toolchain & version manager    |

You normally do not install these separately.
rustup installs and manages everything.

## rustup – Rust Installer & Version Manager

`rustup` is the official Rust installer and toolchain manager.

- It allows you to:
- Install Rust
- Update Rust
- Switch Rust versions
- Manage multiple toolchains (stable, beta, nightly)
- Add components like formatters and linters

## Why rustup is Important

Other languages often break when versions change.
Rust avoids this by using rustup-managed toolchains.

You can safely:

- Use stable for production
- Use nightly for experiments
- Switch per project if needed

## Rust Toolchain Channels

Rust has three main release channels:

| Channel     | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| **stable**  | Default, safe, production-ready |
| **beta**    | Next stable version (testing)   |
| **nightly** | Experimental features           |

```sh
rustup toolchain list
```

Output:

```
stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
```

Switch toolchain:

```
rustup default stable
```

## cargo – Rust’s Package Manager

`cargo` is Rust’s:

- Build system
- Dependency manager
- Project manager

It handles:

- Compiling code
- Downloading libraries
- Running programs
- Testing & formatting

**Why Cargo Matters**

Without Cargo:

- Manual compilation is painful
- Dependency management is hard

With Cargo:

```
cargo run
```

…does everything automatically.

## Rust Editions (Very Important Concept)

A Rust edition defines:

- Language rules
- Syntax behavior
- Compiler defaults

Editions do NOT break old code.

Rust guarantees:

> Code written for one edition will keep working forever.

### Rust Editions Timeline

| Edition | Notes                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 2015    | First Rust edition                 |
| 2018    | Major improvements                 |
| 2021    | Better defaults (current standard) |
| 2024    | Newest (optional, evolving)        |

### Where Edition Is Defined

In `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "rust_basics"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"
```

### Why Editions Exist

Without editions:

- Language improvements could break old code

With editions:

- New syntax is opt-in
- Old projects remain stable

Think of editions like:

> “Language modes”

### Example Showing Edition Behavior (Conceptual)

Modern Rust (2021 edition) allows:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("a", 1);
}
```

Older editions required extra syntax.

Edition = ruleset, not a version lock.

## Adding a Dependency Example

`Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
```

`main.rs`

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let n = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=6);
    println!("Dice roll: {}", n);
}
```

Run:

```sh
cargo run
```

Cargo automatically:

- Downloads rand
- Compiles it
- Links it

## Common Rust Toolchain Commands

| Command                 | Purpose          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `rustup update`         | Update Rust      |
| `rustup toolchain list` | Show toolchains  |
| `cargo build`           | Compile          |
| `cargo run`             | Build & run      |
| `cargo check`           | Fast error check |
| `cargo test`            | Run tests        |
