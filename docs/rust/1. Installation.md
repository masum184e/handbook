## Rust Toolchain Overview

Before installing, it’s important to understand three key tools:

### rustc

- The Rust compiler
- Converts Rust code into executable programs

### cargo

- Rust’s package manager and build system
- Handles:
  - Creating projects
  - Managing dependencies
  - Building and running code
  - Testing

### rustup

- The installer and version manager
- Installs and updates:
  - rustc
  - cargo
  - Standard libraries
- Allows switching between Rust versions

You only need to install `rustup`. It automatically installs `rustc` and `cargo`.

## Installing Rust Using rustup

### Windows

1. Go to: https://www.rust-lang.org
2. Click Install
3. Download and run rustup-init.exe
4. When prompted:

```sh
1) Proceed with installation (default)
```

Press Enter

Windows users may need Microsoft C++ Build Tools.
rustup will tell you if they are missing.

## Verify Installation

After installation, restart your terminal and check:

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup --version
```

Example output:

```sh
rustc 1.75.0 (82e1608df 2024-01-02)
cargo 1.75.0 (1d8b05cdd 2024-01-01)
rustup 1.26.0
```

This confirms Rust is installed correctly.

## How rustup Works (Important Concept)

Check installed toolchains

```sh
rustup toolchain list
```

Update Rust

```sh
rustup update
```

Set default toolchain

```sh
rustup default stable
```

Rust has:

- stable → recommended for beginners
- beta
- nightly
