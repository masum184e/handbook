WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) is a compatibility layer developed by Microsoft that allows you to run a GNU/Linux environment (like Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, etc.) directly on Windows, without needing a virtual machine (VM) or dual-boot setup.

It lets developers and system admins use Linux tools (like `bash`, `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, etc.) alongside their Windows apps.

## Key Features of WSL

1. Run Linux inside Windows – Access Linux terminal and tools directly from Windows.
2. No Virtual Machine overhead – Unlike VMware or VirtualBox, WSL is lightweight and efficient.
3. Direct file access – You can access Windows files from Linux and vice versa.

   - From Linux: `/mnt/c/Users/...`
   - From Windows: `\\wsl$\<distro_name>`

4. Supports Linux commands & software – You can install software via `apt`, `dnf`, or other Linux package managers.
5. Interoperability – Run Linux commands inside Windows and Windows executables inside Linux (`explorer.exe`, `notepad.exe`).
6. Two Versions:

   - WSL 1 → Uses a translation layer, slower for I/O.
   - WSL 2 → Uses a lightweight virtualized Linux kernel, faster, supports Docker & full system calls.

## Installing WSL

Search `Windows feature on or off` in the search bar and enable `Windows subsystem for linux` and `Virtual Machine Platform`

### Step 1: Enable WSL

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```bash
wsl --install
```

This installs the latest version of WSL (by default WSL 2) with Ubuntu.

### Step 2: Check installed distributions

```bash
wsl --list --verbose
```

Example Output:

```bash
  NAME      STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu    Running         2
```

### Step 3: Launch Linux

From PowerShell or CMD:

```bash
wsl
```

Or open Ubuntu from Start Menu.

## Basic Usage Examples of WSL

### 1. Running Linux Commands

Inside WSL terminal:

```bash
ls -la
pwd
uname -r
```

- `ls -la` → lists files with details
- `pwd` → prints current directory
- `uname` -r → shows Linux kernel version

### 2. Accessing Windows Files from Linux

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Desktop
ls
```

This shows your Windows Desktop files from Linux.

### 3. Accessing Linux Files from Windows

In Windows Explorer, type:

```bash
\\wsl$\Ubuntu\home\your_username
```

This opens your Linux home directory from Windows.

### 4. Running Windows Programs inside Linux

```bash
notepad.exe myfile.txt
explorer.exe .
```

- Opens `myfile.txt` in Notepad (Windows).
- Opens current Linux directory in Windows File Explorer.

### 5. Installing Linux Packages

Example: Installing Git and Node.js in WSL:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git nodejs -y
```

## WSL for Development

Suppose you are a web developer:

1. Install Ubuntu with WSL:

```bash
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

`wsl -l -o` return all the available distrubution 2. Inside Ubuntu, install Nginx and start server:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo service nginx start
```

3. Open browser in Windows → visit `http://localhost` → Nginx welcome page appears (because WSL shares the same network).

This allows you to develop Linux-based applications directly from Windows.

## Why we need to install Redis

Redis was originally built for Linux/Unix systems, not Windows. While there used to be a Windows port years ago, it’s no longer officially maintained. That’s why, on Windows 10 or 11, the easiest and most reliable way to run Redis is through Linux — and that’s exactly what WSL provides.
