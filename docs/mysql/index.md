MySQL is an open-source Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
It is used to store, organize, and manage data in a structured way using tables (rows & columns).

- **Relational Database** → Data is stored in tables, and tables can be related to each other using primary keys and foreign keys.
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** → MySQL uses SQL to interact with data (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- **Open Source** → Free to use, with community and enterprise editions.
- **Cross-platform** → Works on Windows, Linux, macOS.
- **Widely used** → Powers many web applications like WordPress, Facebook (initially), YouTube, etc.
- **Client-server model** → MySQL server handles database operations while clients (applications, users) interact with it via SQL.
- **ACID compliance (when using InnoDB engine)** → Ensures data reliability and integrity in transactions.
