## Avoid Functions in WHERE Clause

When you wrap a column in a function, indexes cannot be used.

Bad:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE YEAR(hire_date) = 2020;
```

MySQL must evaluate `YEAR()` for every row → slow.

Good:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE hire_date >= '2020-01-01' AND hire_date <= '2020-12-31';
```

Uses index on `hire_date`. Much faster.

## Use Query Caching (if available)

- In older MySQL versions → Query Cache can store results.
- In MySQL 8+ → use external caching (e.g., Redis, Memcached).

Example:

Instead of repeatedly running:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE status = 'Pending';
```

Cache the result in Redis and refresh periodically.

## Avoid N+1 Query Problem

Bad practice: running multiple queries in a loop.

Bad:

```sql
-- For each employee, fetch department
SELECT dept_name FROM departments WHERE id = 101;
SELECT dept_name FROM departments WHERE id = 102;
SELECT dept_name FROM departments WHERE id = 103;
```

This runs many queries → very slow.

Good (single JOIN query):

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

One query instead of many. Huge performance boost.
