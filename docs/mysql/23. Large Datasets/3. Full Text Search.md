Normally, searching text with LIKE '%word%' is slow on large datasets because MySQL must scan every row.

Full-Text Search (FTS) solves this by creating a special index designed for text searching.
It allows efficient searching for words and phrases in large text fields.

- A Full-Text Index is an index type optimized for text-based columns (`CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`).
- It supports:
  - Natural language search (search like Google).
  - Boolean search (with operators like +, -, \*).
  - Query expansion (broaden results).

**Creating a Full-Text Index**

```sql
CREATE TABLE articles (
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(200),
  body TEXT,
  FULLTEXT(title, body)
);
```

## Searching with Full-Text Index

### Natural Language Search

MySQL searches for relevant results based on word frequency (ignores very common words like "the", "is").

```sql
SELECT id, title
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, body) AGAINST ('database security');
```

Finds rows where `database` and `security` appear. Results are ranked by relevance (higher score = better match).

### Boolean Mode Search

Allows use of operators for precise control.

```sql
SELECT id, title
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, body) AGAINST ('+mysql -oracle' IN BOOLEAN MODE);
```

- `+mysql` → Must contain "mysql".
- `-oracle` → Must not contain "oracle".

Returns only MySQL-related articles, excluding Oracle.

Other Boolean operators:

- `*`→ wildcard (e.g., databas\* matches "database", "databases").
- `""` → exact phrase search (e.g., `"data security"`).

### Query Expansion Mode

Expands the search using related terms from top matching rows.

```sql
SELECT id, title
FROM articles
WHERE MATCH(title, body) AGAINST ('encryption' WITH QUERY EXPANSION);
```

Finds not only "encryption" but also related terms found in matching articles (e.g., "security", "keys").
