## Categories

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL statements define and modify the structure of a database.

- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP

### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML statements manipulate data stored in tables.

- INSERT
- SELECT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

### 3. Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL manages access to data.

- GRANT
- REVOKE

## CRUD

### Creation

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (columns) VALUES (values);
```

- Column and value order should be same
- It's not mandatory to follow the order of column as same as the order of column during definition, just maintain that it's follow order in sql command
- Any value that goes into a `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `DATE` or `TEXT` column has single quotes
- You can skip column names but values order should be same as column and can't leave any column
- For multiple insertion separate all tuple with comma
- You can insert data only in specified columns by skipping other column name in sql command

### READ

```sql
SELECT */column_name FROM table_name;
```

- `*` return all column

### UPDATE

1. **Updating a Single Column for a Single Record:**

   You can use a simple UPDATE statement to modify a single column for a single record:

   ```sql
   UPDATE table_name
   SET column_name = value
   WHERE column_name = value;
   ```

2. **Updating Multiple Columns for a Single Record:**

   You can update multiple columns at once by separating each column-value pair with a comma:

   ```sql
   UPDATE table_name
   SET column_name_1 = value_1, column_name_2 = value_2
   WHERE condition;
   ```

3. **Updating Multiple Records with a Single Column Using CASE:**

   If you want to update multiple records conditionally, based on specific criteria, you can use `CASE` within the `UPDATE` statement. Note that the `CASE` expression is used to modify a single column based on conditions.

   ```sql
   UPDATE table_name
   SET column_name = CASE
                       WHEN condition_1 THEN new_value_1
                       WHEN condition_2 THEN new_value_2
                       ELSE column_name
                     END
   WHERE some_condition;
   ```

   This `CASE` statement allows you to conditionally assign new values to a column based on multiple conditions, but remember, only one column can be updated in this case.

### DELETE

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name=value;
```

- `WHERE` is necessary otherwise all records will be delete

## `WHERE`

Apply the most restrictive conditions first in the `WHERE` clause to minimize the dataset as early as possible.

It is used in SQL to filter records from a table based on specific conditions.

```sql
WHERE column_name operator 'value';
```

### Operators

**1. Comparison Operators**

- `=`: Equal to
- `!=` or `<>`: Not equal to
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to

**2. Logical Operators**

- `AND`: Combines multiple conditions; all must be true.
- `OR`: Combines multiple conditions; at least one must be true.
- `NOT`: Reverses the result of a condition.

**3. Wildcard Operators**

- `LIKE`: Matches patterns (e.g., `%` for any sequence of characters).
- `IN`: Matches a list of values.
- `BETWEEN`: Checks if a value is within a range.

**4. NULL Check**

- `IS NULL`: Checks if a value is `NULL`.
- `IS NOT NULL`: Checks if a value is not `NULL`.

## Sorting

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
```

## LIMIT

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;
```

- `row_count`: The maximum number of rows to return.
- `offset` (optional): The number of rows to skip before starting to return rows.

## Aliases

It provide temporary names for columns or tables in a query to make them more readable or easier to reference. These aliases exist only for the duration of the query and do not affect the actual database schema.

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_column_name
FROM table_name AS alias_table_name;
```

Just put the alias name after actual name by following a `AS`.
