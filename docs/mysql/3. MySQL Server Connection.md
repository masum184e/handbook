The MySQL server runs as a service (daemon) in the background.
We (the users or applications) connect to it using:

- Command Line Interface (CLI)
- MySQL Workbench (GUI)
- Programming Languages (Python, PHP, Java, Node.js, etc.)

### Connecting via Command Line

The mysql client is a command-line program installed with MySQL.

```vasg
mysql -h hostname -u username -p
```

- `-h` → host (where MySQL is running, default is `localhost`).
- `-u` → username (default is `root`).
- `-p` → prompts for password.

**Local Connection:**

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

It will ask for the root password. Once entered, you get the `mysql>` prompt.

Now you can run queries

**Remote Connection:**

```bash
mysql -h mydb-instance.abcd1234.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
```
