When starting with MySQL, you have two main options for installation:

1. Local Setup → Install MySQL on your personal computer/server.
2. Cloud-Based Solutions → Use MySQL as a managed service from cloud providers.

Both have their own use cases, so let’s explore them.

### Local Setup

- Download MySQL Installer
  - Visit MySQL official downloads.
  - Choose version: Community Edition (free, open source).
- Install MySQL Server
  - Run the installer.
  - Select "MySQL Server" and optionally tools like:
    - MySQL Workbench (GUI for database design/queries).
    - MySQL Shell (advanced CLI).
- Configure Server
  - Choose:
    - Port (default: 3306).
    - Authentication (strong password for root user).
    - Data directory (where your DB files will be stored).
- Verify Installation

  - Open terminal/command prompt and type:

    ```bash
    mysql -u root -p
    ```

  - Enter your password → You’re inside the MySQL shell.

### Cloud Solutions

Running MySQL on cloud platforms allows you to offload infrastructure management (hardware, networking, patching, backups) while focusing on database usage, scaling, and replication.

**Using MySQL on Amazon RDS**

1. Create RDS Instance
   - Go to AWS Console → RDS → Create database.
   - Select MySQL as the engine.
   - Choose free tier (for practice).
   - Set username (admin) and password.
2. Get Connection Endpoint

   - AWS gives you a host URL like:

     ```bash
     mydb-instance.abcd1234.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
     ```

3. Connect to Cloud MySQL

   From local machine:

   ```
   mysql -h mydb-instance.abcd1234.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -u admin -p
   ```

   Enter password → You are now connected to the cloud DB.

4. Run SQL Queries

### Local vs Cloud Setup

| Feature          | Local Setup                  | Cloud Setup                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Installation** | Manual (installer, config)   | Ready-to-use (just create instance) |
| **Cost**         | Free (Community Edition)     | Pay-as-you-go (some free tiers)     |
| **Scalability**  | Limited by your machine      | Auto-scaling, global reach          |
| **Maintenance**  | You manage backups, upgrades | Managed by cloud provider           |
| **Best for**     | Learning, small projects     | Production apps, enterprise systems |
