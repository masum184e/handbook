- **Database:** A database is an organized collection of structured data, stored and managed so that it can be efficiently accessed, retrieved, and updated.

- **Table:** A table is a structured arrangement of data in rows and columns within a database. Each table usually represents a particular entity (e.g., Users, Products).

- **Row (Record):** A row represents a single entry or record in a table. It contains values for all the defined columns, describing one specific instance of the entity.

- **Column (Field):** A column defines an attribute of the entity, specifying the type of data each record must include. Each column has a name and a data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR).
