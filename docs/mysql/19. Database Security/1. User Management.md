## User Management

MySQL has a user management system to control who can access the database and what actions they can perform. This is part of database security, ensuring only authorized users can perform operations.

### Creating Users in MySQL

MySQL users are stored in the `mysql.user` table. Each user is identified by:

- Username
- Host (where they can connect from)

Syntax:

```sql
CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

- `'username'` → Name of the user.
- `'host'` → Hostname/IP the user can connect from.
  - `'localhost'` → User can connect only from the same machine as the MySQL server.
  - `'%'` → Wildcard, allows connection from any host.
- `'password'` → Password for authentication.

Example:

```sql
CREATE USER 'john'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'securePass123';
```

This creates a user john who can connect only from localhost with password `securePass123`.

## Granting Privileges

Once a user is created, they usually don’t have any privileges.
We assign permissions using the `GRANT` statement.

Syntax:

```sql
GRANT privilege_list ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';
```

- `privilege_list` → Type of access (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `ALL PRIVILEGES`).
- `database.table` → Scope of privileges.
  - `*.*` → All databases and tables.
  - `mydb.*` → All tables in database mydb.
  - `mydb.employees` → Only the employees table in mydb.

**Grant all privileges on a specific database**

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON company.* TO 'john'@'localhost';
```

**Grant limited privileges**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON company.* TO 'john'@'localhost';
```

### Revoking Privileges

If a user should no longer have some permissions, use the `REVOKE` statement.

Syntax:

```sql
REVOKE privilege_list ON database.table FROM 'username'@'host';
```

Example:

```sql
REVOKE INSERT ON company.employees FROM 'john'@'localhost';
```

John can still read (`SELECT`) the employees table, but can no longer `INSERT` new rows.

### Viewing User Privileges

To check what privileges a user has:

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'john'@'localhost';
```

Example Output:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'john'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '*HASH'
GRANT SELECT ON `company`.`employees` TO 'john'@'localhost'
```

### Dropping Users (if no longer needed)

```sql
DROP USER 'john'@'localhost';
```

Completely removes the user and their privileges.
