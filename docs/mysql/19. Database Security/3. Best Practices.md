### Use Strong Authentication & Passwords

- Always use strong, complex passwords.
- Enforce password policies (length, complexity, expiration).
- Never leave the root account with no password.

```sql
ALTER USER 'john'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Secur3#Pass!';
```

This ensures the user has a strong password.

You can also enforce password expiration:

```sql
ALTER USER 'john'@'localhost' PASSWORD EXPIRE INTERVAL 90 DAY;
```

### Follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)

- Users should only get the minimum privileges required for their job.
- Avoid granting `ALL PRIVILEGES` unless absolutely necessary.
- Never give `SUPER` or `GRANT OPTION` to normal users.

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON company.employees TO 'hr_user'@'localhost';
```

`hr_user` can read and add employee data, but cannot delete or drop tables.

### Remove Anonymous & Unused Accounts

MySQL by default may create anonymous accounts ('`'@'localhost'`). These are dangerous.

```sql
DROP USER ''@'localhost';
DROP USER ''@'%';
```

Removes potential backdoors.

Also, remove test databases if not needed:

```sql
DROP DATABASE test;
```

### Use Encrypted Connections (SSL/TLS)

- Protect sensitive data by encrypting client-server communication.
- Require SSL for critical users.

```sql
CREATE USER 'secure_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'StrongPass123' REQUIRE SSL;
```

Ensures that `secure_user` can only connect via SSL/TLS.

### Secure the Root Account

- Don’t use `root` for application connections.
- Restrict `root` login to localhost.

```sql
CREATE USER 'dbadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Adm1n#Pass!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dbadmin'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Use dbadmin for administration and disable root remote login:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' ACCOUNT LOCK;
```

### Regularly Apply Updates & Patches

- Always run the latest MySQL version to patch vulnerabilities.
- Keep OS and MySQL-related libraries updated.

Example command (Linux):

```sql
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade mysql-server
```

### Enable Logging & Auditing

Enable the general log or audit log plugin to monitor suspicious activity.

Monitor failed login attempts.

```ini
[mysqld]
log_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log
general_log = 1
general_log_file = /var/log/mysql/general.log
```

This helps trace what queries were executed and by whom.

### Backup Data Securely

- Regular backups protect against accidental loss and ransomware.
- Store backups encrypted.

Example backup with encryption:

```bash
mysqldump -u backup_user -p company | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -out backup.sql.enc
```

### Restrict Network Access

- Bind MySQL to localhost if not needed remotely.
- Use firewalls to restrict which IPs can connect.

Example (`my.cnf`):

```ini
[mysqld]
bind-address = 127.0.0.1
```

This ensures MySQL is only accessible locally.

For remote access, allow specific IPs only:

```sql
CREATE USER 'app_user'@'192.168.1.100' IDENTIFIED BY 'AppPass#1';
```

### Use Data-at-Rest Encryption

- Encrypt sensitive tables or entire storage using MySQL Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) or OS-level disk encryption.

Example (per-table encryption):

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  salary DECIMAL(10,2)
) ENCRYPTION='Y';
```
