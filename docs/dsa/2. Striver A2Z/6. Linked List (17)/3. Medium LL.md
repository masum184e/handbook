1. Middle of LL
2. Reverse LL - Iterative
   - Bruteforce uses single stack
   - Iterative uses three pointer(`prev`, `next`, `current`)
3. [Reverse LL - Recursive](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
4. Detect Loop
5. Begin of Loop
   - In Loop condition use `fast && fast->next`
   - If `slow` and `fast` are not equal, loop not found, begining is `NULL`
   - The iteration to find begining will run untill `slow` and `fast` are equal.
   - `head` to begining node is equal to `n*i+/-k`
   - Return node will be slow/fast
6. Length of Loop
   - After loop detection both pointer point to same node, move one to next
   - Intialize counter with `1` as the current one will not consider in the loop
7. Pallindrome
8. Segrregate odd and even
9. Remove Nth node from the back
10. Delete Middle Node
   - Optimization done with only TortoiseHare method with extra pointer with `NULL` value
   - Use a `NULL` pointer approach to remove any type of remove operation
11. [Sort LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/)
12. Sort a LL of 0's 1's and 2's by changing links

14. [Add 1 to a number represented by LL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/add-1-to-a-number-represented-as-linked-list/1)
15. [Add 2 numbers in LL](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
