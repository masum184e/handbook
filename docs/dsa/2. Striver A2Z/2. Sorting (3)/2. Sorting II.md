1. Merge Sort
   - Recursive call, then merge
   - For merge
     - Extract size
     - Extract item
     - Merge
     - Reassign item
     - All condition for resiging/extracting should follow less than equal format
   - (`l>r`) condition may causes infinitie recursion, use (`l>=r`) instead.
   - Left half is `[l...m]` and right half is `[m+1...r]`
2. Recursive Bubble Sort
   - Set the termination condition properly (at begin)
   - Replace the outer loop with recursive call (at end, can work before loop as well)
3. [Recursive Insertion Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/insertion-sort/1)
4. [Quick Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/quick-sort/1)
   <!-- - Kind of reverse approach of merge
     - Get pivot
     - Reverse call
   - Place the pivot at right place -->
