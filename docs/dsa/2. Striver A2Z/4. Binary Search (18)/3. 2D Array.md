2. [Search in 2D matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/)
3. [Row Column Wise Sorted Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/)
    <!-- - Focus and Top-Right Strategy and find out why
    - If we focus on top-left, or bottom-right, each time we iterate we will iterate two way where both item will be smaller than the previous one
    - If we focus on top-right or bottom-left, each time we iterate we will iterate tow way where one item will be smaller another one will be greater -->
