## Submission

- Latest: Dec 23, 2025.
- Next: **Dec 30, 2025**.
- Focus: Rotation.
- Solve all of them without watching notes, tutorial, solution or anything but **following timer**.
  - Time **30-60 min**s
  - Without watching anything
  - Take time, apply on **paper first**
  - Analysis the complexity
  - Brute Force -> Better -> Optimal
- **Just solve it by yourself**.
- If fail, try next day, don't take help.
- If its still failed, read this document **once** vert carefully, then try again, don't watch tutorial, solution or anything else.
- After completion of all, noted down the final learing in concepts.

## Problem

1. [Find X](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)
2. [Lower Bound](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-lower-bound/1)
   <!-- - The first index where an element is ≥ target (`arr[i] >= target`). -->
3. [Upper Bound](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/implement-upper-bound/1)
   <!-- - The first index where an element is > target (`arr[i] > target`).
   - Implmentation is as same as Lower Bound, Both return `left`, just modify the condition. -->
4. [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)
   <!-- - Sept 19, 2025
   - Feb 12, 2025
   - Dec 21, 2025
   - Solve Again without watching the solutions. -->
5. [Floor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/floor-in-a-sorted-array-1587115620/1)/[Ceil](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ceil-in-a-sorted-array/1)
6. [First and Last Occurences](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)
<!-- 
   - **If `target` exists in the array:**

     - First Occrrence = Lower Bound
     - Last Occurrence = Upper Bound - 1
     - Ceil = Floor = `arr[lower_bound]`

     ```
     0  1 2 3  4 5
     -------------
     1 [2 2 2] 3 4 - target = 2
       ^       ^
       lb      ub
     ```

     - First Occurrence = `lower_bound` = 1
     - Last Occurrence = `upper_bound` - 1 = 3
     - Ceil = Floor = `arr[lower_bound]` = 2

   - **If `target` doesn't exists in the array:**
     - `lower_bound` = `upper_bound`
     - First Occurrence = `-1`
     - Last Occurrence = `-1`
     - Ceil = `arr[lower_bound]`
     - Floor = `arr[lower_bound - 1]`
     ```
     1 2 |4 4 5 - target = 3
           ^
        lb = ub = 2
     ```
     - First Occurrence = `-1`
     - Last Occurrence = `-1`
     - Ceil = `arr[lower_bound]` = `4`
     - Floor = `arr[lower_bound - 1]` = `arr[1]` = `2` -->
7. [Count Occurences](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-of-occurrence2259/1)
8. [Search in Rotated Sorted](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
   <!-- - Solve Again without watching the solutions.
   - Search in Portion
   - Search when left half is sorted
   - Search when right half is sorted
   - First check which portion is sorted, not where target is placed. -->
9. [Search in Roated Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)
   <!-- Previous approach breaks for duplicate values

   ```cpp
   nums = [2,2,2,3,2,2], target = 3
   l = 0, m = 2, r = 5
   nums[l] == nums[m] == nums[r] == 2
   ``` -->
10. [Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
    <!-- - When you return `nums[left]`,`while(left <= right)` may cause out of bound error, use `<` instead and may one of the pointer update with equal to `mid` not incremented or decremented. -->
11. [Count rotation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotation4723/1)
12. [Signle Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)
13. [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
