1. Two Sum
   - `unordered_map`: easy to access
   - `map`: sorted useage
   - To apply two pointer approach, array need to be sorted, if not sorted use hash map.
2. Sort Color
   - mid is move with left and mid
   - right is reduced to mid
   - that's why mid can be targetting for tracking iteration
3. Majority Element
4. Kadane's Algorithm
