1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
   - Implemented Brute Force
   - Explore Better and Optimal Approach without watching solution
   - Approaches are perfect, just watched the solution

<!-- - `unordered_map`: easy to access
   - `map`: sorted useage
   - To apply two pointer approach, array need to be sorted, if not sorted use hash map. -->

2. [Sort Color](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)
   <!-- - mid is move with left and mid
   - right is reduced to mid
   - that's why mid can be targetting for tracking iteration -->
3. [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)
4. [Kadane's Algorithm](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
5. [Print Sub Array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/maximum-sub-array5443/1)
6. [Stcok Buy And Sell](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)
   <!-- - Just simply find the minium and maximum(not the elements) -->
7. [Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://leetcode.com/problems/rearrange-array-elements-by-sign/)
