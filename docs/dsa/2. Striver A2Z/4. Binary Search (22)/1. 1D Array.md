1. Find X
2. Lower Bound
   - The first index where an element is ≥ target (`arr[i] >= target`).
3. Upper Bound
   - The first index where an element is > target (`arr[i] > target`).
   - Implmentation is as same as Lower Bound, Both return `left`, just modify the condition.
4.
5. Flower/Ceil
6. First and Last Occurences

   - **If `target` exists in the array:**

     - First Occrrence = Lower Bound
     - Last Occurrence = Upper Bound - 1
     - Ceil = Floor = `arr[lower_bound]`

     ```
     0  1 2 3  4 5
     -------------
     1 [2 2 2] 3 4 - target = 2
       ^       ^
       lb      ub
     ```

     - First Occurrence = `lower_bound` = 1
     - Last Occurrence = `upper_bound` - 1 = 3
     - Ceil = Floor = `arr[lower_bound]` = 2

   - **If `target` doesn't exists in the array:**
     - `lower_bound` = `upper_bound`
     - First Occurrence = `-1`
     - Last Occurrence = `-1`
     - Ceil = `arr[lower_bound]`
     - Floor = `arr[lower_bound - 1]`
     ```
     1 2 |4 4 5 - target = 3
           ^
        lb = ub = 2
     ```
     - First Occurrence = `-1`
     - Last Occurrence = `-1`
     - Ceil = `arr[lower_bound]` = `4`
     - Floor = `arr[lower_bound - 1]` = `arr[1]` = `2`

7. Count Occurences
8. Search in Rotated Sorted
   - Search in Portion
   - Search when left half is sorted
   - Search when right half is sorted
9. 
10. 
11. 
12. Signle Element
    - Focus on mid value
13.
