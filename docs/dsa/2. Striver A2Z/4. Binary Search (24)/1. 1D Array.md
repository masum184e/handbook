## Submission

- Latest: Dec 23, 2025.
- Next: **Dec 30, 2025**.
- Focus: Rotation.
- Solve all of them without watching notes, tutorial, solution or anything but **following timer**.
  - Time **30-60 min**s
  - Without watching anything
  - Take time, apply on **paper first**
  - Analysis the complexity
  - Brute Force -> Better -> Optimal
- **Just solve it by yourself**.
- If fail, try next day, don't take help.
- If its still failed, read this document **once** vert carefully, then try again, don't watch tutorial, solution or anything else.
- After completion of all, noted down the final learing in concepts.

## Problem
1. Find X
2. Lower Bound
3. Upper Bound
4. [Search Insert Position](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-insert-position/)
5. [Floor](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/floor-in-a-sorted-array-1587115620/1)/[Ceil](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/ceil-in-a-sorted-array/1)
6. [First and Last Occurences](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/)
<!-- Implment with both BS and STL -->
7. Count Occurences
8. Search in Rotated Sorted
9. [Search in Roated Sorted II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)
   <!-- Previous approach breaks for duplicate values

   ```cpp
   nums = [2,2,2,3,2,2], target = 3
   l = 0, m = 2, r = 5
   nums[l] == nums[m] == nums[r] == 2
   ``` -->
10. [Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
    <!-- - When you return `nums[left]`,`while(left <= right)` may cause out of bound error, use `<` instead and may one of the pointer update with equal to `mid` not incremented or decremented. -->
11. [Count rotation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotation4723/1)
<!-- is it same with count occurences -->
12. [Signle Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-element-in-a-sorted-array/)
13. [Find Peak Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/)
