   - There are total 4 possible combination, correct combination consider as false combination
2. https://codeforces.com/contest/1878/problem/C
   - Not sum of [1, ..., n], consider sum of last k digit

   - List of common divisor shouldn't consider if `i == gcd/i`
6. https://codeforces.com/contest/282/problem/A
7. https://codeforces.com/contest/1475/problem/A
   - even - even = result_even  
     even - odd = result_even  
     here dividing result_even by 2 doesn't produce the odd one, divide the result even by `2^k`/`n & (n - 1)`
8. https://codeforces.com/contest/1617/problem/B
   - Approach was right but consider wrong(`i`, `n-i`) case instead (`i`, `n-i-1`) as another number is 1, it shouldn't be consider
   - order of printing matter
   - gcd checking should be begin with `2`

11. https://codeforces.com/contest/2192/problem/A
    - Intitution was wrong
    - Frequency count fail for `abab`
    - Consider the last and first character
12. https://codeforces.com/contest/2203/problem/A

13. codeforces.com/contest/2203/problem/B
    - Intitution was right, just couldn't impelement it
    - Check the constraint(input the integer as string)
    - Sort it, reduce the large digits from sum, special consideration for first character in string

    - Using both (+2,+1) and (+4,-1) is equivalent to using two (+3,0) moves.
