Logical data structure uses physical data structure to implement itself.

## Physical Data Structure

- How data is actually stored in memory(RAM, disk).
- Deals with the real-world representation.
- Involves memory management, allocation, data storage.
- Impact performance and access speed.
- Examples: **Array, Linked List**.

## Logical Data Structure

- How data is conceptually organized and how operation performed on it.
- It define relationships, hierarchy.
- Examples: **Stack, Queue**.
