- Focus on final optimal solution
- Solve complex problem by breaking them down into simpler sub-problem
- **Solve** each sub-problem **only once and store** the result

## Memoization - Top Down
- Recursive
- Store cache value
- Small set of input
- Solve overlapping sub-problem
## Tabulation - Iterative
- Iterative
- Store array
- Large set of input
- Do not overlap
