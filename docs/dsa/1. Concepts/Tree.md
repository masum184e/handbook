## Tree Traversal

### BFS

- Level Order

### BFS

- `preorder : root -> left -> right`
    - Prefix expression are generated from expressoin tree of the expression.
    - A copy of the tree is generated from preorder traverse.
- `inorder : left -> root -> right`
    - Expression are extracted from inorder tree of the expressoin.
    - In BST, to extract item in non-decresing order, perform reverse inorder(`HOW`)
- `postorder: left -> right -> root`
    - Post expression are generated from expressoin tree of the expression.
