1. Merge Sort
   - recursive call, then merge
   - for merge
     - extract size
     - extract item
     - merge
     - reassign item
   - (`l>r`) condition may causes infinitie recursion, use (`l>=r`) instead.
   - left half is `[l...m]` and right half is `[m+1...r]`

4. Quick Sort
   - kind of reverse approach of merge
