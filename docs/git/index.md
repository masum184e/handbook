Welcome to the Git handbook.

**Character Used in VS Code**

- `U` -> Untracked: nothing is added to staging state
- `A` -> Added: added to staging state but no commit is done
- `M` -> Modify: some changes are made
- `D` -> Deleted

**Quick Notes**

- Mark down allow html syntax
- GitHub is **Case Sensitive**, that's why we have to use exact file name
