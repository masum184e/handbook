## `-u`

The `-u` flag (short for `--set-upstream`) is used with `git push` to set the upstream (tracking) branch for your local branch. This means that after using this flag once, you can simply run `git push` or `git pull` without specifying the remote and branch.

If we don't use `-u`, we need to specify the branch whenever we want to push.

## `-message`

The `-m` flag (short for `--message`) is used with `git commit` to provide a commit message directly in the command. This avoids opening the default text editor for writing a commit message.

**Multi-line commit message:**

```shell
git commit -m "Fixed the login issue" -m "Resolved bug where incorrect credentials were not handled properly."
```

If you run `git commit` without `-m`, Git will open your default text edittor to enter detailed commit message. `git commit <message>` will occur error.

## `--move`

- Renames a branch only if the new branch name does not already exist.
- If the target branch name exists, the command fails with an error message.

**`--move --force`**

It's short form is `-M`

- Renames a branch even if the new branch name already exists.
- Forces the renaming by overwriting the existing branch.
