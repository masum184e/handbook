## Contents

### HEAD

- **Purpose:** Points to the currently checked-out branch.
- **Location:** `.git/HEAD`
- **Contents:** Typically contains a reference like `ref: refs/heads/main`, which tells Git which branch is currently active.

### config

- **Purpose:** Stores repository-specific configuration settings.
- **Location:** **.git/config**
- **Contents:** Includes settings like remote repositories, user information, and merge behavior.

### description

- **Purpose:** Used by GitWeb (a web interface for Git) to describe the repository.
- **Location:** .git/description
- **Contents:** A simple text description. Has no effect on repository behavior.

### hooks

- **Purpose:** Contains scripts for automating actions before or after certain Git events (e.g., commits, pushes, or merges).
- **Location:** `.git/hooks/`
- **Example Hooks:**
  - `pre-commit` – Runs before a commit is created.
  - `post-commit` – Runs after a commit is made.
  - `pre-push` – Runs before a push operation.

### info

- **Purpose:** Contains metadata about the repository, including ignored files.
- **Location:** `.git/info/`
- **Contents:**
  - `exclude` – A local `.gitignore` file that applies only to this repository.

### objects

- **Purpose:** Stores all the data (blobs, trees, commits, and tags) in a compressed format.
- **Location:** `.git/objects/`
- **Structure:**
  - `objects/`
    - `info/` – Optional, used for performance optimization.
    - `pack/` – Stores packed objects for efficiency.
    - SHA1-named directories (e.g., e9/) – Each file inside is a Git object.

### refs

- **Purpose:** Stores references to commits, such as branches and tags.
- **Location:** `.git/refs/`
- **Contents:**
  - `heads/` – Contains branch references (e.g., `.git/refs/heads/main`).
  - `tags/` – Stores tag references.
  - `remotes/` – Contains remote-tracking branches.

### logs

- **Purpose:** Keeps a history of reference changes (like branch checkouts).
- **Location:** `.git/logs/`
- **Contents:**
  - `HEAD` – Tracks changes to the `HEAD` reference.
  - `refs/heads/` – Logs branch updates.
  - `refs/remotes/` – Logs remote-tracking branch changes.

### index

- **Purpose:** A staging area (cache) for changes before committing.
- **Location:** `.git/index`
- **Contents:** A binary file containing information about the working tree.

### packed-refs

- **Purpose:** Optimizes repository performance by storing references in a single file instead of multiple files.
- **Location:** `.git/packed-refs`
- **Contents:** Contains packed branch and tag references.
