`.gitignore` forces files to be untracked. Files that we do not want to share are described inside `.gitignore`.

Place the `.gitignore` file in your root directory.

## Examples

- `ignore.txt` → Ignore the `ignore.txt` file
- `*.txt` → Ignore all files with the `.txt` extension
- `temp/` → Ignore the `temp` folder
- `!main.txt` → Do not ignore `main.txt` (exception rule)
- `ignore?.txt` → Ignore files like `ignore1.txt`, `ignore2.txt`, `ignoreA.txt` (matches exactly one character after `ignore`)
- `ignore????.txt` → Ignore files starting with `ignore` followed by exactly 5 characters
- `ignore*.txt` → Ignore all files starting with `ignore`

## Notes

- `git status` displays the working directory and staging area (tracked and untracked files).
- You can check whether `.gitignore` is working using `git status`.
- If it's working, some files will appear as untracked.
- When creating a new repository, there is an option to add a `.gitignore` file.
- You can select a `.gitignore` template based on your application (e.g., Node, Android, etc.).
