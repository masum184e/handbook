Git rebase is a powerful command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving or rewriting commit history. It is an alternative to `git merge`, but instead of creating a merge commit, it rewrites the commit history to keep it linear.

## Why Use Git Rebase?

- **Keeps commit history clean and linear:** Instead of multiple merge commits, rebase makes it appear as if all work happened sequentially.

- **Avoids unnecessary merge commits:** It moves your feature branch commits on top of the latest commit from the main branch.

- **Useful for integrating changes from remote branches:** Before pushing changes, rebasing ensures your branch is up-to-date.

## Example

Let's say you are working on a feature branch (`feature-branch`), and the `main` branch has received updates. Instead of merging, you decide to use rebase.

```
main:
A --- B --- C    (main)

feature-branch:
       \
        D --- E  (feature-branch)
```

- `A → B → C` are the commits in the `main` branch.
- `D → E` are commits in the `feature-branch`, which was created from B.

Now, suppose `main` has received new commits (`C`), and you want to update your `feature-branch` with these latest changes.

1. Switch to `feature-branch`.
2. Rebase your branch onto `main`: `git rebase main`
   **What happens now:**

- Git moves commits `D` and `E` aside.
- It updates `feature-branch` with the latest changes from `main` (i.e., commits `C`).
- Then, it reapplies `D` and `E` on top of `C`.

3. **Handling Conflicts:**
   If there are conflicts, Git will pause the rebase and show a message:
   To resolve, manually fix the conflict in the affected files, use `git add` to stage teh resolved files. Continue the rebase:

```
git rebase --continue
```

4. Successfully Rebased History

```
main:
A --- B --- C   (main)
            \
             D' --- E'  (feature-branch)
```

Now, `D` and `E` have been reapplied as `D'` and `E'` on top of `C`, keeping history linear.

## Differences: Rebase vs Merge

| Feature            | Merge                      | Rebase                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commit History** | Creates a merge commit     | Keeps history linear                                |
| **Commit Order**   | Branches remain separate   | Commits appear as if they were created sequentially |
| **Use Case**       | Preserves original history | Makes history cleaner                               |

## Commands

- `git rebase <branch>` – Rebase your current branch onto another branch.
- `git rebase --interactive <commit> (-i)` – Start an interactive rebase for modifying commits.
- `git rebase --continue` – Continue rebase after resolving conflicts.
- `git rebase --abort` – Abort rebase and return to the original branch state.
- `git rebase --skip` – Skip the current conflicting commit and continue rebase.
- `git rebase --onto <new-base> <old-base> <branch>` – Rebase a branch onto a different base.
- `git pull --rebase` – Fetch changes and rebase instead of merging.
