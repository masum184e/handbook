It is used to undo changes by moving the HEAD (current branch pointer) to a different commit. It allows you to remove commits, unstage changes, or discard modifications in the working directory.

## Types

| Reset Mode | Description                                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--soft`   | Moves the branch pointer to a previous commit but keeps changes staged.                                     |
| `--mixed`  | Moves the branch pointer to a previous commit and unstages changes but keeps them in the working directory. |
| `--hard`   | Moves the branch pointer to a previous commit and discards all changes.                                     |

## Commands

- `git reset <commit>` – Moves the branch to a specific commit (default: mixed reset).
- `git reset --soft <commit>` – Moves the branch to a commit, keeping changes staged.
- `git reset --mixed <commit>` – Moves the branch to a commit, unstaging changes (default behavior).
- `git reset --hard <commit>` – Moves the branch to a commit and deletes all changes.
- `git reset HEAD <file>` – Unstages a file without changing its content.
- `git reset --hard HEAD` – Discards all uncommitted changes.
- `git reset --keep <commit>` – Like --hard but preserves uncommitted changes that do not conflict.
- `git reset --merge` – Aborts a failed merge, similar to `git merge --abort`.

## Comparison

| Feature      | `git reset`                   | `git revert`                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **History**  | Removes commits               | Creates a new commit to undo changes |
| **Safety**   | Can be destructive (`--hard`) | Safe for shared branches             |
| **Use Case** | Undo commits locally          | Undo commits in a public branch      |
