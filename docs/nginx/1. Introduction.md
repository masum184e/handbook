NGINX (pronounced “engine-x”) is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, load balancer, and HTTP cache.

It is designed to:

- Handle very high traffic
- Use low memory
- Serve many concurrent users efficiently

NGINX is widely used by companies like Netflix, Google, Cloudflare, GitHub, and WordPress.com.

## Why NGINX Was Created

Traditional web servers (like Apache) use a process/thread-based model, which can consume a lot of memory under heavy traffic.

NGINX was created to solve:

- Poor performance under high concurrency
- High CPU and memory usage
- Slow response times during traffic spikes

NGINX uses an event-driven, asynchronous architecture, making it faster and more scalable.

## What Can NGINX Do? (Core Uses)

NGINX can act as:

1. Web Server – Serve static & dynamic content
2. Reverse Proxy – Forward requests to backend servers
3. Load Balancer – Distribute traffic across servers
4. HTTP Cache – Cache responses for faster delivery
5. SSL/TLS Termination – Handle HTTPS encryption
6. API Gateway – Manage API traffic

## NGINX Architecture Basics
**Event-Driven Model**

- Uses non-blocking I/O
- One worker can handle thousands of connections
- Very low memory usage

**Main Components**

- Master Process – Manages configuration and worker processes
- Worker Processes – Handle client requests
- Configuration File – Controls behavior (`nginx.conf`)

## NGINX vs Apache (Basic Comparison)
| Feature         | NGINX               | Apache                |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |
| Architecture    | Event-driven        | Process-based         |
| Performance     | Very high           | Moderate              |
| Memory usage    | Low                 | High                  |
| Static files    | Excellent           | Good                  |
| Dynamic content | Via proxy (PHP-FPM) | Built-in              |
| Best for        | High traffic        | Small to medium sites |

## Basic NGINX Concepts
### 1. Server Block (Virtual Host)

Equivalent to Apache’s VirtualHost.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /var/www/html;
}
```
### 2. Location Block

Defines how requests are handled.
```nginx
location /images/ {
    root /data;
}
```
### 3. Reverse Proxy

Forwards requests to backend servers.
```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
}
```


## NGINX as a Web Server

You want NGINX to serve a static website.
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name mysite.com;

    root /var/www/mysite;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```
- `listen` 80 → Listens on HTTP port 80
- `server_name` → Domain name
- `root` → Website files location
- `index` → Default page
- `try_files` → Prevents invalid requests

## NGINX as a Reverse Proxy

Your app runs on Node.js (port 3000), but users access port 80.
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

- NGINX receives client requests
- Forwards them to Node.js
- Sends the response back to the client
- Client never sees backend server details

## NGINX as a Load Balancer

Distribute traffic across 3 backend servers.
```nginx
upstream backend_servers {
    server 192.168.1.10;
    server 192.168.1.11;
    server 192.168.1.12;
}

server {
    listen 80;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backend_servers;
    }
}
```

- `upstream` defines backend servers
- Requests are distributed using round-robin
- Improves availability and performance

## NGINX Caching
```nginx
location / {
    proxy_cache my_cache;
    proxy_pass http://backend;
}
```

- Stores responses
- Reduces backend load
- Improves response speed


## Advantages of NGINX

- High performance
- Handles massive traffic
- Low memory usage
- Easy reverse proxy
- Built-in load balancing
- Excellent for microservices

## When to Use NGINX

- You expect high traffic
- You need reverse proxy or load balancing
- You want fast static file serving
- You need API gateway or caching
