An index file is the default file that NGINX serves when a client requests a directory URI (i.e., a URL ending with /) without specifying a filename.

For example:

http://example.com/   → NGINX serves /var/www/html/index.html


This avoids 404 errors and allows automatic loading of homepage or default page.

2. Core Directive: index
Syntax
index file1 file2 ...;

Context

http, server, location

Explanation

NGINX tries each file in order until one exists

Stops at the first match

Can be overridden per location

3. Simple Example
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html index.htm;
}

Behavior
Request	Resolved File
/	/var/www/html/index.html
/about/	/var/www/html/about/index.html
/docs/ (no index)	404
4. index Directive in Location Blocks

You can override default index behavior per path:

location /docs/ {
    index home.html main.html;
}


Request: /docs/ → NGINX checks:

/var/www/html/docs/home.html

/var/www/html/docs/main.html

First existing file served

5. Interaction with try_files

For modern setups, try_files is often combined with index:

location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}

Explanation

$uri → file requested

$uri/ → directory requested → check for index

/index.html → fallback for single-page apps (SPA)

Common for React, Angular, Vue apps

6. Directory Index Listing

NGINX does not automatically list files if no index exists (returns 403/404)

To enable listing:

location /downloads/ {
    autoindex on;
    index index.html;
}


If index.html exists → served

Else → directory listing

7. Examples With Multiple Index Files
server {
    root /var/www/html;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;
}

Explanation

NGINX checks in order:

index.php → for PHP apps

index.html → fallback

index.htm → last resort

Useful for sites with legacy files

8. Index Files and Reverse Proxy

When NGINX is used as a reverse proxy, you can still serve static index files:

location / {
    root /var/www/app;
    index index.html;
    try_files $uri $uri/ @backend;
}

location @backend {
    proxy_pass http://backend;
}


Static files served directly if they exist

Requests for missing files forwarded to backend

9. Index Files in HTTPS
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.com;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;

    ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/example.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/example.key;
}


Behavior same as HTTP

Index files are critical for default pages under SSL

10. Common Mistakes
Mistake	Effect
Not defining index	403/404 on directory access
Wrong order of files	NGINX serves wrong file
Forgetting trailing slash in directory URL	Redirection occurs (301)
Index file missing	404
Conflicting index in multiple locations	Unintended file served
11. Debugging Index Issues

Test with curl:

curl -I http://example.com/


Check Location: header (redirects)

Check NGINX error logs for missing index files:

tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

12. Best Practices

✔ Always define index in http or server context
✔ Use multiple files in order for backward compatibility
✔ Combine try_files for SPA applications
✔ Avoid exposing directory listings unless intentional
✔ Ensure proper file permissions for security

13. Real-World Production Example
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/example;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}

Explanation

NGINX serves static index files if they exist

Falls back to PHP for dynamic pages

Ensures backward compatibility and SPA support

14. Summary

index files define default page for a directory request

Directive supports multiple files in order

Works with root, alias, try_files, and proxy setups

Critical for serving static sites, SPAs, and default landing pages

Must be combined with proper security and caching for production
