Exact matching tells NGINX:

> “Match this `location` only if the request URI is exactly the same—no more, no less.”

If the URI differs even by one character, the match fails.

```
location = /path {
    ...
}
```

- `=` means exact match only
- No regex
- Case-sensitive
- Highest priority in location matching

## How Exact Matching Works

```
location = /login {
    return 403;
}
```

| Request URI     | Match? | Why                  |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------- |
| `/login`        | Yes    | Exact                |
| `/login/`       | No     | Extra `/`            |
| `/login?user=1` | Yes    | Query string ignored |
| `/Login`        | No     | Case-sensitive       |

Query strings are ignored during location matching.

## Priority: Exact Match Always Wins

NGINX location matching order:

1. Exact match (`=`) ← highest priority
2. Longest prefix match
3. Regex match
4. `location /` fallback

Once an exact match is found, NGINX stops searching immediately.

## Protect a Sensitive URL

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location = /admin {
        deny all;
    }

    location /admin/ {
        auth_basic "Admin Area";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
    }
}
```

| Request           | Result           |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `/admin`          | ❌ Access denied |
| `/admin/`         | 🔐 Auth required |
| `/admin/settings` | 🔐 Auth required |

Exact match allows fine-grained control.

## Exact Match vs Prefix Match

```
location = /about {
    return 200 "Exact About";
}

location /about {
    return 200 "Prefix About";
}
```

| Request       | Matched Location |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| `/about`      | `= /about`       |
| `/about/`     | `/about`         |
| `/about/team` | `/about`         |

## Common Use Cases for Exact Matching

1. Redirect a single URL

```
location = /old-page {
    return 301 /new-page;
}
```

2. Block a specific endpoint

```
location = /xmlrpc.php {
    deny all;
}
```

3. Optimize performance for hot URLs

```
location = /health {
    access_log off;
    return 200 "OK";
}
```

4. Override application routes

```
location = /favicon.ico {
    access_log off;
    log_not_found off;
}
```

## Exact Match with `try_files`

```
location = / {
    try_files /index.html =404;
}
```

- Applies only to `/`
- Does not affect `/anything-else`

## Common Mistakes

- Expecting `/path/` to match `/path`
- Forgetting query strings don’t affect matching
- Overusing exact matches where prefix is better
- Thinking exact matches apply to subpaths
