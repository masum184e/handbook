Express is a web framework built on top of Node.js’ HTTP module, designed to make development faster and more straightforward.

It streamlines tasks such as:

- **Routing:** Managing how your app responds to different requests
- **Middleware:** Running functions before sending responses
- **Request & Response Handling:** Simplifying the processing of client requests and server responses
- **Serving Static Files:** Easily delivering images, CSS, JavaScript, and other assets
- **Error Handling:** Managing and responding to errors efficiently

## Why Use Express.js?

Without Express, building a server in Node.js requires writing a lot of **boilerplate code**:

- Parsing URLs manually
- Writing conditional statements for routing (e.g., `if (req.url === "/home")`)
- Handling different request methods (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- Managing responses

Express simplifies all of this, allowing you to focus on your application logic rather than low-level details by managing the **boilerplate**.
