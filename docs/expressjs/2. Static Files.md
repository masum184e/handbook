Static files are files that don’t change dynamically on the server side.

- HTML files (web pages)
- CSS files (styling)
- JavaScript files (frontend scripts)
- Images (JPG, PNG, SVG, GIF)
- Fonts / PDFs / Docs

Instead of writing routes for every file (like `/about.html`, `/style.css`), Express provides a built-in middleware `express.static` to serve them automatically.

## How It Works

1. Put your static files in a folder (commonly named public).

2. Use the middleware:

   ```ts
   // Serve static files from the "public" directory
   app.use(express.static("public"));

   // Example route
   app.get("/", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
     res.sendFile(__dirname + "/public/index.html");
   });
   ```

3. Now Express will serve files directly from that folder.
