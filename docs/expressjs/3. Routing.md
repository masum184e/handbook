Routing in Express.js defines how your server responds to client requests at different endpoints (URLs) and HTTP methods.

Each route has:

1. **HTTP Method**: Such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`.
2. **Path**: The endpoint or route URL.
3. **Callback Function**: Code to execute when the route is matched.

```ts
app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER);
```

## Route parameters

Dynamic values in the URL path, defined using a colon (`:`).

```ts
// GET /users/123
app.get("/users/:id", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const userId: string = req.params.id; // Extract :id from URL
  res.send(`You requested user with ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

Useful for identifying resources (user IDs, product IDs, etc.).

- `res.json()` - Automatically sets `Content-Type: application/json`.
- `res.send()` - Automatically sets `Content-Type` based on input:

## Query strings

Key-value pairs added after a `?` in the URL.

```ts
// GET /search?name=Alice&age=25
app.get("/search", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const name: string | undefined = req.query.name as string;
  const age: string | undefined = req.query.age as string;

  res.send(`Searching for user. Name: ${name}, Age: ${age}`);
});
```

Useful for filtering, searching, sorting, or optional parameters.

## Grouping Routes

- `express.Router()` lets you create modular route handlers.
- Instead of writing all routes in `index.ts`, you can split them into separate files (e.g., `userRoutes.ts`, `productRoutes.ts`).
- This keeps the code clean, organized, and scalable.
