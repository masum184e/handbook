    "# K-means Clustering\n",
    "K-means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into a predefined number of groups, or \"clusters,\" where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It‚Äôs popular for grouping and understanding data structures, pattern recognition, and image compression.\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- __Clusters and Centroids__: Clusters are the groups that data points are divided into, and each cluster has a central point called a centroid, which is the mean position of all points in the cluster.\n",
    "- __K (Number of Clusters)__: The user defines the number of clusters, denoted by K. Choosing K can be tricky and is often done through methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.\n",
    "- __Distance Measure__: K-means often uses Euclidean distance to measure the similarity between points and the centroids.\n",
    "- __Iterations__: K-means iteratively refines the clusters by recalculating the centroids and reassigning points until the algorithm converges (the cluster assignments no longer change or a maximum number of iterations is reached).\n",
