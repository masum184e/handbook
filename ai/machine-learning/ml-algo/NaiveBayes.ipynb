    "# Naive Bayes\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes’ Theorem, commonly used for classification task. It is called \"naive\" because it assumes that the features in the data are independent of each other, which is rarely the case in real-world scenarios. Despite this naive assumption, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well in many domains, particularly in text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis."
