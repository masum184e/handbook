    "# Multiple Linear Regression\n",
    "MLR is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between two or more independent variables (predictors) and a single dependent variable (target). In MLR, the relationship is assumed to be linear, meaning the target variable can be approximated as a linear combination of the predictors.\n",
