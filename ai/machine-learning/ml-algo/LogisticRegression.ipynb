    "# Logistic regression\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical method used for `binary classification` problems, where the outcome variable is categorical and has two possible values, often represented as 0 or 1. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a specific class, using a logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function)\n",
